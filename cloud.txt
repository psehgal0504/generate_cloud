Human bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are heterogeneous progenitor cells with two 
defining features, self-renew and multi-lineage differentiation. As one of the
differentiation directions, osteogenesis is vital for bone homeostasis. A growing
body of evidences show that ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays an
essential role in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In this study, we
found that LMCD1 was upregulated during osteogenic differentiation process of
BMSCs by analyzing GSE80614. In vitro and in vivo functional studies confirmed
that LMCD1 was critical to the osteogenic commitment of BMSCs. Compared to those 
of the controls, downregulation of LMCD1 significantly restrained osteogenic
differentiation and enhanced adipogenic differentiation, while upregulation of
LMCD1 increased the osteogenic differentiation and suppressed adipogenic
differentiation. Mechanically, we found that LMCD1 could protect RUNX2 and Smad1 
protein from Smurf1-induced ubiquitination degradation thereby regulating BMP
signaling. In conclusion, our findings suggest that LMCD1 is a novel regulator of
osteogenic differentiation and may be a potential therapeutic target for bone
metabolism related diseases.

Cnidium lactone stimulates osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal 
stem cells via BMP-2/smad-signaling cascades mediated by estrogen receptor.

Road, Jingjiang, Taizhou 214500, Jiangsu Province, China.

Our aim was to study the osteogenic effect of cnidium lactone for bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and its potential mechanism. BMSCs were isolated
and identified by flow cytometry and multidirectional differentiation capacity.
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to identify the optimal concentration of
cnidium lactone. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red S (ARS) was
performed to identify whether cnidium lactone has effect on osteogenesis at early
and late phase respectively. Moreover, we used estrogen receptor antagonist,
ICI182780, to identify the receptor of cnidium lactone. The expression of
Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Osterix (OSX), osteopontin (OPN),
estrogen receptor (ER), Smad4, p-Smad1, Smad1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2
(BMP-2) protein were measured by PCR and western blot. Cnidium lactone (2 μM)
demonstrated increased osteogenesis after osteogenic inducible medium (OIM)
induction, as evidenced by more ALP activity and mineralization. When blocked
with ICI182780, osteogenesis capacity was decreased. Moreover, the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting results indicated that cnidium lactone 
enhanced ER, BMP2, Smad1, Smad4, RUNX2, OSX, and OPN expression and Smad1
phosphorylation. Cnidium lactone can effectively stimulates osteogenic
differentiation of BMSCs via BMP-2/Smad-Signaling cascades mediated by ER.

BACKGROUND: Identifying bone anabolic agents is a superior strategy for the
treatment of osteoporosis. Naturally, derived coumarin derivatives have shown
osteoanabolic effect in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the
effect of 5'-Hydroxy Auraptene (5'-HA), a coumarin derivative that newly isolated
from Lotus lalambensis Schweinf on the differentiation of the mouse bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal (skeletal) stem cells (mBMSCs) into osteoblast and
adipocyte.
METHODS: The effect of 5'-HA on mBMSCs cell proliferation and osteoblast
differentiation was assessed by measuring cell viability, quantitative alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization
and osteogenic gene array expression. Adipogenesis was measured by Oil Red O
staining and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) analysis of adipogenic markers.
Regulation of BMPs signaling pathways by 5'-HA was measured by Western blot
analysis and qPCR.
RESULTS: 5'-HA showed to stimulate the differentiation of mBMSCs into osteogenic 
cell lineage in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting their differentiation 
into adipocytic cell lineage. Treatment of mBMSCs with 5'-HA showed to promote
significantly the BMP2-induced osteogenesis in mBMSCs via activating Smad1/5/8
phosphorylation and increasing Smad4 expression. Blocking of BMP signaling using 
BMPR1 selective inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly inhibited the stimulatory
effect of 5'-HA on osteogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data identified 5'-HA, as a novel coumarin derivative that
function to stimulate the differentiation of mBMSCs into osteoblasts in
BMP-signaling dependent mechanism.

Chordin-like 1 (CHRDL1) is a secreted glycoprotein with repeated cysteine-rich
domains, which can bind to BMPs family ligands. Although it has been reported to 
play important roles in several systems, the exact roles of CHRDL1 on human bone 
mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) osteogenesis remain to be explored. The present
study aimed to investigate the roles of CHRDL1 on the osteogenic differentiation 
of hBMSCs and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that CHRDL1 was
upregulated during hBMSCs osteogenesis, and rhBMP-4 administration could enhance 
CHRDL1 mRNA expression in a dose and time dependent manner. Knockdown of CHRDL1
did not affect hBMSCs proliferation, but inhibited the BMP-4-dependent osteogenic
differentiation, showing decreased mRNA expression levels of osteogenic markers
and reduced mineralization. On the contrary, overexpression of CHRDL1 enhanced
BMP-4 induced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Moreover, in vivo experiments
by transplanting CHRDL1 gene modified hBMSCs into nude mice defective femur
models displayed higher new bone formation in CHRDL1 overexpression groups, but
lower new bone formation in CHRDL1 knockdown groups, compared with control
groups. In consistent with the bone formation rate, there were increased CHRDL1
protein expression in new bone formation regions of defective femur in CHRDL1
overexpression groups, while reduced CHRDL1 protein expression in CHRDL1
knockdown groups compared with control groups. These indicate that CHRDL1 can
promote osteoblast differentiation in vivo. Furthermore, the mechanisms study
showed that CHRDL1 improved BMP-4 induced phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9 during
osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Besides, promotion of osteogenic
differentiation and the activation of SMAD phosphorylation by CHRDL1 can be
blocked by BMP receptor type I inhibitor LDN-193189. In conclusion, our results
suggested that CHRDL1 can promote hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation through
enhancing the activation of BMP-4-SMAD1/5/9 pathway.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential effects of
sclerostin (SOST) on the biological funtions and related mechanisms of
cementoblasts under mechanical stress.
METHODS: OCCM-30 cells were treated with varying doses of SOST (0, 25, 50, and
100 ng·mL⁻¹) and were loaded with uniaxial compressive stress (2 000 μ strain
with a frequency of 0.5 Hz) for six hours. Western blot was utilized to detect
the expressions of β-catenin, p-smad1/5/8, and smad1/5/8 proteins. Alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined, and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction was used to measure the expressions of runt-related transcription 
factor 2 (Runx-2), osteocalcin (OCN), bone sialoproteins (BSP), receptor
activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA.
RESULTS: The expression of p-smad 1/5/8 was significantly downregulated with
increasing SOST. β-catenin and smad1/5/8 exhibited no difference. ALP activity
decreased under mechanical compressive stress with increasing SOST
concentrations. Runx-2 expression was reduced with increasing SOST
concentrations, and a similar trend was observed for the BSP and OCN expressions.
When the SOST concentration was enhanced, RANKL expression gradually increased,
whereas the expression of OPG decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: Under mechanical comprehensive stress, SOST can adjust the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) /smad signal pathway. Osteosclerosis inhibits the
mineralization of cementoblasts under mechanical compressive stress, which may be
achieved by inhibiting the expressions of osteogenesis factors (Runx2, OCN, BSP, 
and others) and by promoting the ratio of cementoclast-related factors
(RANKL/OPG) through BMP signal pathways.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a degenerative skeletal disease with a limited number
of treatment options. CK2.3, a novel peptide, may be a potential therapeutic. It 
induces osteogenesis and bone formation in vitro and in vivo by acting downstream
of BMPRIA through releasing CK2 from the receptor. However, the detailed
signaling pathways, the time frame of signaling, and genes activated remain
largely unknown.
METHODS: Using a newly developed fluorescent CK2.3 analog, specific inhibitors
for the BMP signaling pathways, Western blot, and RT-qPCR, we determined the
mechanism of CK2.3 in C2C12 cells. We then confirmed the results in primary
BMSCs.
RESULTS: Using these methods, we showed that CK2.3 stimulation activated OSX,
ALP, and OCN. CK2.3 stimulation induced time dependent release of CK2β from
BMPRIA and concurrently CK2.3 colocalized with CK2α. Furthermore, CK2.3 induced
BMP signaling depends on ERK1/2 and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: CK2.3 is a novel peptide that drives osteogenesis, and we detailed
the molecular sequence of events that are triggered from the stimulation of CK2.3
until the induction of mineralization. This knowledge can be applied in the
development of future therapeutics for osteoporosis.

The mechanism of pathological osteogenesis in Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is
largely unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that the imbalance between
BMP-2 and Noggin secretion induces abnormal osteogenic differentiation of
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from AS patients in a
two-dimensional culture environment. In this study, HA/β-TCP scaffolds were
further used as a three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic culture system to mimic the
bone microenvironment in vivo to determine the abnormal osteogenic
differentiation of AS-MSCs. We demonstrated that when cultured in HA/β-TCP
scaffolds, AS-MSCs had a stronger osteogenic differentiation capacity than that
of MSCs from healthy donors (HD-MSCs) in vitro and in vivo. This dysfunction
resulted from BMP2 overexpression in AS-MSCs, which excessively activated the
Smad1/5/8 and ERK signalling pathways and finally led to enhanced osteogenic
differentiation. Both the signalling pathway inhibitors and siRNAs inhibiting
BMP2 expression could rectify the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of AS-MSCs.
Furthermore, BMP2 expression in ossifying entheses was significantly higher in AS
patients. In summary, our study demonstrated that AS-MSCs possess enhanced
osteogenic differentiation in HA/β-TCP scaffolds as a 3D biomimetic
microenvironment because of BMP2 overexpression, but not Noggin. These results
provide insights into the mechanism of pathological osteogenesis, which can aid
in the development of niche-targeting medications for AS.

BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP-2) and retinoic acid (RA) are 
osteoinductive factors that stimulate endogenous mechanisms of bone repair which 
can be applied on management of osseous defects in oral and maxillofacial fields.
OBJECTIVE: Considering the different results of RA on osteogenesis and its
possible use to substitute/potency BMP-2 effects, this study evaluated the
outcomes of BMP-2, RA, and BMP-2+RA treatments on in vitro osteogenic
differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and the signaling
pathway(s) involved.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: ASCs were treated every other day with basic osteogenic
medium (OM) alone or supplemented with BMP-2, RA, or BMP-2+RA. Alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined using the r-nitrophenol method.
Extracellular matrix mineralization was evaluated using von Kossa staining and
calcium quantification. Expression of osteonectin and osteocalcin mRNA were
determined using qPCR. Smad1, Smad4, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8, BMP-4, and BMP-7
proteins expressions were analyzed using western blotting. Signaling pathway was 
evaluated using the IPA® software.
RESULTS: RA promoted the highest ALP activity at days 7, 14, 21, and 28, in
comparison to BMP-2 and BMP-2+RA. BMP-2+RA best stimulated phosphorylated
Smad1/5/8 protein expression at day 7 and Smad4 expression at days 7, 14, 21, and
28. Osteocalcin and osteonectin mRNA expressions were best stimulated by BMP-2+RA
at day 7. Matrix mineralization was most improved by BMP-2+RA at days 12 and 32. 
Additionally, BMP-2+RA promoted the highest BMP signaling pathway activation at
days 7 and 14, and demonstrated more activation of differentiation of
bone-forming cells than OM alone.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, RA increased the effect of BMP-2 on osteogenic
differentiation of human ASCs.

Introduction: Alcoholism can lead to low mineral density, compromised
regenerative bone capacity and delayed osteointegration of dental implants. This 
may be partially attributed to the inhibitive effect of all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA), a metabolite of alcohol, on osteoblastogenesis. Our previous studies
demonstrated that heterodimeric bone morphogenetic protein 2/7 (BMP2/7) was a
more potent BMP than homodimeric BMP2 or BMP7, and could antagonize the
inhibitive effect of ATRA to rescue osteoblastogenesis.
Materials and methods: In this study, we compared the effectiveness of BMP2/7,
BMP2 and BMP7 in restoring osteoblastogenesis of murine preosteoblasts upon
inhibition with 1 µM ATRA, and we further analyzed the potential mechanisms. We
measured the following parameters: cell viability, ALP, OCN, mineralization, the 
expression of osteogenic differentiation marker genes (Collagen I, ALP and OCN)
and the expression of BMP signaling key genes (Dlx5, Runx2, Osterix and Smad1).
Results: BMP2/7 treatment alone induced significantly higher osteoblastogenesis
compared to BMP2 and BMP7. When cells were treated by ATRA, BMP2/7 was superior
only in rescuing cell viability and ALP activity, compared to BMP2 or BMP7.
However, BMP2/7 was not superior to BMP2 or BMP7 in restoring OCN expression and 
extracellular mineralized nodules, or in rescuing expression of two key
osteogenic genes, Dlx5 and Runx2. Irrespective of their dimeric types or potency,
the selected BMPs could antagonize the inhibitory effect of ATRA on
osteoblastogenesis.
Conclusion: The presence of ATRA, BMP2/7 still induced significantly higher cell 
viability and early differentiation than the homodimers. However, ATRA
significantly attenuated the advantages of BMP2/7 in inducing late and final
osteoblastogenic differentiation over the homodimers.

Abstract: The effect of sialoglycoprotein isolated from Gadous morhua eggs
(Gm-SGP) on ovariectomized (OVX) induced osteoporosis, which is characterized by 
high bone turnover activity was investigated. Results revealed that Gm-SGP
significantly increased bone mineral density, enhanced bone biomechanical
properties and repaired the microstructure of the trabecular bone. Also, the
treatment with Gm-SGP remarkably decreased biochemical marker contents or
activities, such as serum BALP, PICP, BMP-2, TrACP, Cath-K, urine Ca and P,
leading to the reduction in bone turnover. The elevation in the rate of bone
formative process contributed in the increase of bone turnover. Both BMP-2/Smads 
and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways played an important role in osteogenesis.
Gm-SGP suppressed the key factors expression in these two pathways such as BMP-2,
Smad1, Smad4, Lrp-5b, Runx2, Osx, ALP, Col1, OCN and β-catenin. These findings
might provide some theoretical basis for the application of Gm-SGP as a potential
anti-osteoporotic drug or as functional food.

The forkhead box C1 (Foxc1) protein, a member of the forkhead/winged helix
transcription factor family, is required in stem cell developmental processes.
Recently, multiple studies have indicated the crucial role of Foxc1 in
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, but the precise effects and mechanisms on 
dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) remain unclear. In this study, we evaluate the
role of Foxc1 on the odontogenic differentiation and proliferation of DPSCs. Our 
results show that Foxc1 decreases time dependently in odontogenic differentiation
of DPSCs. Meanwhile, overexpression of Foxc1 could significantly inhibit the
mineralization of DPSCs and the expression of odontogenic-related genes, such as 
runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), dentin sialophosphoprote (DSPP), and
dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP-1). Foxc1 overexpression does not
significantly alter the proliferation of DPSCs. In addition, Foxc1 reduces the
expression of p-Smad1/5, an important modulator of bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP)/Smad signaling pathway, inhibiting BMP/Smad signaling pathway. In
conclusion, our data demonstrated that Foxc1 inhibits odontogenic differentiation
of DPSCs and odontogenic-related gene expression through the BMP/Smad signaling
pathway which may be useful for the dental regeneration and repair.

Bone remodeling occurs via coupling between bone resorption by osteoclasts and
bone formation by osteoblasts. The mechanisms that regulate osteoclast signals to
osteoblasts are not well understood. Published studies have reported that BMP
signaling in osteoclasts regulate osteoclast coupling targets. To investigate the
necessity of canonical BMP signaling on osteoclast differentiation and coupling, 
we mated Smad1fl/fl; Smad5fl/fl mice to c-Fms-Cre mice. We analyzed male mice at 
3 months of age to determine the skeletal phenotype of the Smad1fl/fl;
Smad5fl/fl;c-Fms-Cre (SMAD1/5 cKO) mice. There was a 1.2-fold decrease in
trabecular BV/TV in SMAD1/5 cKO. Analyses of osteoclast serum markers in SMAD1/5 
cKO mice, showed a significant increase in CTX-1 (1.5 fold) and TRAP ELISA (3
fold) compared to control mice. In these same mice, there was a 1.3-fold increase
in cortical thickness. Consistent with the increase in cortical thickness, we
found a 3-fold increase in osteoblast activity as measured by P1NIP ELISA assay
from SMAD1/5 cKO mice. To explain the changes in cortical thickness and P1NP
activity, we determined conditioned media from SMAD1/5 cKO osteoclast cultures
enhanced mineralization of an osteoblast cell line and coupling factors expressed
by osteoclasts that regulate osteoblast activity Wnt1 (4.5-fold increase), Gja1
(3-fold increase) and Sphk1 (1.5-fold increase) were all upregulated in
osteoclasts from SMAD1/5 cKO compared to control osteoclasts. Lastly osteoclasts 
treated with dorsomorphin, a chemical inhibitor of SMAD1/5 signaling,
demonstrates an increase in Wnt1 and Gja1 expression similar to the SMAD1/5 cKO
mice. Previous studies demonstrated that TGF-β signaling in osteoclasts leads to 
increases in WNT1 expression by osteoclasts. Therefore, our data suggest that
TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways in osteoclasts could act in an antagonistic
fashion to regulate osteoblast activity through WNT1 and other coupling factors.

The molecular mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis (OA) and Kashin-Beck disease
(KBD) remain poorly understood. Hypertrophic chondrocytes serve an important role
in the development of both OA and KBD, whereas oxidative stress can contribute to
the pathological progression of cartilage damage. Therefore, the aim of the
present study was to detect altered expression of osteogenesis-related genes in
hypertrophic chondrocytes, following treatment with 3-morpholinosydnonimine
(SIN-1). ATDC5 cells were induced to develop into hypertrophic chondrocytes via
Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium. The appropriate concentration and time of SIN-1
treatment was determined via MTT assay. Following hypertrophic chondrocyte
stimulation with SIN-1, a liquid chip was analyzed using a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) array. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was conducted on
individual genes to validate the array-based data. Analyses of protein-protein
interactions, gene ontology functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway enrichment of the differentially expressed genes were also performed. A
total of 6 upregulated and 34 downregulated genes were identified, including the 
mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) family (Smad1-4), bone
morphogenetic proteins and their receptors (Bmp2, Bmp3, Bmpr1α and Bmpr1β), and
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2,-9 and-10). These genes are associated with
collagen biology, transcriptional control, skeletal development, bone mineral
metabolism, and cell adhesion. SIN-1 induced death of hypertrophic chondrocytes
likely through TGF-β/Smad or BMP/Smad pathways. Oxidative-stress-dependent
induction of abnormal gene expression may be associated with chondronecrosis in
the cartilage of patients with OA or KBD.

BACKGROUND: Icariin, a major active flavonoid glucoside, is widely used for the
treatment of bone injury and rebuilding in the clinic because of its roles in
suppressing osteoblastogenesis and promoting osteogenesis. The
senescence-accelerated mouse SAMP6 was accepted as a useful murine model to
reveal the mechanism of senile osteoporosis and the therapeutic mechanism of drug
activity. However, little is known about the characteristics of SAMP6 osteoblasts
and the associated regulatory roles of icariin.
METHODS: We isolated and cultured osteoblasts from SAMP6 or SAMR1 mice and
compared their proliferation, migration, and differentiation by performing the
CCK-8 assay, cell counting assay, EdU staining, cell cycle analysis, ALP staining
and activity measurement, Alizarin red staining, and RT-qPCR analysis to measure 
the levels of osteoblast markers, including RUNX2, Colla1 and Oc. To assess the
effects of icariin on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation, after BMP-2
treatment, osteoblast markers were analyzed by RT-qPCR and semi-quantitative
Western blotting. The effects of icariin on connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) were measured by RT-qPCR. shRNA targeting CTGF mRNA was employed to
knockdown its expression level in osteoblasts.
RESULTS: The SAMP6 osteoblasts presented decreased the development and
differentiation activity compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts, indicating that they
are the potential mechanisms underlying age-associated disease. Moreover, SAMP6
osteoblasts presented upregulated CTGF compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts. Icariin
enhanced BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by downregulating CTGF
expression, which tightly regulates osteoblast differentiation. By downregulating
CTGF, icariin treatment upregulated phosphate-Smad1/5/8, indicating its
activating effects on the BMP signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that decreased osteoblast development and
function potentially contributes to age-associated disease. Icariin exerts
enhancing effects on BMP-2-mediated osteoblast development via downregulating
CTGF.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling has been shown to
inhibit osteogenesis. However, therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting PDGF signaling 
to bone regeneration in vivo and the specific mechanisms by which PDGFR signaling
inhibits osteogenic differentiation remain unclear. In the present study, we
examined the osteogenic effect of inhibiting PDGFR using trapidil, a PDGFR
antagonist, in vivo and in vitro, and evaluated its mechanisms. A rat calvarial
defect model was analyzed by micro-computed tomography and histology to determine
the pro-osteogenic effect of trapidil in vivo. In addition, primary mouse
calvarial osteoblast precursors were cultured in osteogenic differentiation
medium with trapidil to study the mechanisms. Trapidil greatly promoted bone
regeneration in a rat calvarial defect model and osteogenic differentiation of
calvarial osteoblast precursors. For the mechanisms, trapidil induced
phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) leading 
to enhance expression of Runx2, crucial transcription factor for osteogenesis.
The pro-osteogenic effects of trapidil were inhibited by LDN193189, specific
inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor, ALK2 and ALK3, and by
depletion of ALK3, and treatment with noggin, an antagonist of BMPs. Moreover,
trapidil showed a synergistic effect with BMP2 on osteogenic differentiation. In 
conclusion, trapidil induced BMPR activity through upregulation of BMP signaling,
leading to promoted osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Attenuated BMPR activity
may be involved in the inhibition of osteogenesis by PDGFR signaling.

Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the overall effect of
quercetin on mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) proliferation and
osteogenic differentiation in vitro.
Materials and Methods: BMSCs were treated with different concentrations of
quercetin for 6 days. The effects of quercetin on cell proliferation were
assessed at predetermined times using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The
cells were then treated with quercetin, estrogen, or an estrogen receptor (ER)
antagonist (which was also administered in the presence of quercetin or estrogen)
for 7 or 21 days. The effects of quercetin on BMSC osteogenic differentiation
were analyzed by an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay kit, Alizarin Red S staining
(ARS), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and western blotting.
Results: The CCK-8 and ALP assays and ARS staining showed that quercetin
significantly enhanced BMSC proliferation, ALP activity, and extracellular matrix
production and mineralization, respectively. The qPCR results indicated that
quercetin promoted osterix (OSX), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2),
and osteopontin (OPN) transcription in the presence of osteoinduction medium, and
the western blotting results indicated that quercetin enhanced bone morphogenetic
protein 2 (BMP2), Smad1, Smad4, RUNX2, OSX, and OPN expression and Smad1
phosphorylation. Treatment with the ER inhibitor ICI182780 blocked the effects of
quercetin.
Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that quercetin promotes BMSC proliferation and
osteogenic differentiation. Quercetin enhances BMP signaling pathway activation
and upregulates the expression of downstream genes, such as OSX, RUNX2, and OPN, 
via the ER.

The Masquelet's induced membrane (IM) technique is widely used to treat large
segmental bone defects due to its physical priority and biological function.
However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the IM on bone formation remains
unknown. In the present study, rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
(BMSCs) were used as an in vitro model and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)
was used as a positive control to evaluate the effects of the IM on the
osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Although the IM group did not exhibit a
significant increase in the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2
(Runx2), Collagen I (Col I), osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
relative to the BMP-2 administration, the IM was considerably effective compared 
with the untreated group. Mechanistically, we found that the IM activated the
Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which was further
confirmed by application of specific inhibitors of Smad1/5/8 (LDN-193189) and
ERK1/2 (U0126). After the combined treatment of the IM and LDN-193189 as well as 
U0126, the IM-induced increase in Runx2, Col I, and OCN expression was
significantly inhibited. These results suggest that IM promotes the osteogenic
differentiation of rat BMSCs by activating the Smad1/5/8 and MAPK pathways.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) potentiates bone formation through the Smad
signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. The transcription factor nuclear factor
κB (NF-κB) suppresses BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. Recently, we
identified that the transactivation (TA) 2 domain of p65, a main subunit of
NF-κB, interacts with the mad homology (MH) 1 domain of Smad4 to inhibit BMP
signaling. Therefore, we further attempted to identify the interacting regions of
these two molecules at the amino acid level. We identified a region that we term 
the Smad4-binding domain (SBD), an amino-terminal region of TA2 that associates
with the MH1 domain of Smad4. Cell-permeable SBD peptide blocked the association 
of p65 with Smad4 and enhanced BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation and
mineralization without affecting the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 or the activation
of NF-κB signaling. SBD peptide enhanced the binding of the BMP2-inudced
phosphorylated Smad1/5 on the promoter region of inhibitor of DNA binding 1
(Id-1) compared with control peptide. Although SBD peptide did not affect
BMP2-induced chondrogenesis during ectopic bone formation, the peptide enhanced
BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation in subcortical bone. Thus, the SBD peptide is
useful for enabling BMP2-induced bone regeneration without inhibiting NF-κB
activity.

DNA methylation is a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the mammalian genome 
and is essential for embryonic development. The three catalytic DNA
methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b, catalyze the methylation
of cytosine. Dnmt3b is highly expressed in chondrocytes and global knockout of
Dnmt3b led to skeletal deformations and embryonic lethality, suggesting an
essential role of Dnmt3b in endochondral bone formation. To further define the
role of Dnmt3b in skeletal development, Dnmt3b was deleted in Col2 positive
chondrocyte lineage cells. Both axial and appendicular skeletal size were reduced
and bone mineralization was delayed in Col2Cre+ ;Dnmt3bf/f (Dnmt3bCol2 ) mice at 
E14.5 and E18.5. While Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) staining showed 
normal chondrocyte columns in control growth plates, the length of hypertrophic
chondrocyte zone and type X collagen expression were decreased in E18.5 growth
plates from Dnmt3bCol2 mice. TUNEL and PCNA staining demonstrated that the delay 
in chondrocyte maturation observed in the Dnmt3bCol2 growth plates was not
secondary to altered chondrocyte apoptosis or proliferation. Complementary in
vitro experiments were performed on primary sternal chondrocytes isolated from
control and Dnmt3bCol2 mice. Gene expression studies confirmed delayed terminal
maturation as Mmp13 and Col10a1 expression was down-regulated in Dnmt3bCol2
chondrocytes. In addition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red staining
confirmed that Dnmt3b deletion in chondrocytes delays in vitro chondrocyte
hypertrophic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Mechanistically, Dnmt3b
gene deletion resulted in decreased BMP signaling through reduction of Smad1
phosphorylation. These findings show that epigenetic factor, Dnmt3b is necessary 
for normal chondrocyte hypertrophic maturation and limb development.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bone nonunion remains a challenge for orthopaedists. The
technological advancements that have been made in precisely silencing target
genes have provided promising methods to address this challenge.
METHODS: We detected the expression levels of the bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) inhibitors Chordin, Gremlin and Noggin using realtime PCR in bone
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from patients with normal fracture
healing and those with bone nonunion. Moreover, we detected the expression of
Chordin, Gremlin and Noggin during the osteogenic differentiation of human BMSCs 
(hBMSCs) using real-time PCR and Western blot. We delivered Chordin siRNA to
hBMSCs using a previously reported cationic polymer, polyspermine
imidazole-4,5-imine (PSI), as a pH-responsive and non-cytotoxic transfection
agent. The apoptosis and cellular uptake efficiency were analysed by flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: We identified Chordin as the most appropriate potential therapeutic
target gene for enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Chordin
knockdown rescued the osteogenic capacity of hBMSCs isolated from patients with
bone nonunion. Highly efficient knockdown of Chordin was achieved in hBMSCs using
PSI. Chordin knockdown promoted hBMSC osteogenesis and bone regeneration in vitro
and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Chordin is a potential target for improving
osteogenesis and bone nonunion therapy and that responsive and non-toxic cationic
polyimines such as PSI are therapeutically feasible carriers for the packaging
and delivery of Chordin siRNA to hBMSCs.

Vitamin C-linker-conjugated Ala-His-Lys tripeptide (Vit C-AHK) is a derivative of
Vitamin C-conjugated tripeptides, which were originally developed as a component 
of a product for collagen synthesis enhancement or human dermal fibroblast
growth. Here, we investigated the effect of Vit C-AHK on bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP)-2-induced osteoblast differentiation in a cell culture model. Vit
C-AHK enhanced proliferation of C2C12 cells and induction of BMP-2-induced
alkaline phosphatase, a typical marker of osteoblast differentiation. Vit C-AHK
also stimulated the phosphorylation and translocation of Smad1/5/8 to the nucleus
and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK1/2
and p38. In addition, Vit C-AHK enhanced the BMP-2-induced mRNA expression of
osteoblast differentiation-related genes such as ALP, BMP-2, Osteocalcin, and
Runx2. Our results suggest that Vit C-AHK exerts an enhancing effect on
osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through activation of Smad1/5/8 and 
MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 signaling and without significant cytotoxicity. These results
provide important data for the development of peptide-based bone-regenerative
agents and treatment of bone-related disorders.

Osteoporosis is a widespread musculoskeletal deformity that affects thousands of 
older people every year, leading to bone abnormalities and ultimately increasing 
the risk of bone fractures in both genders. It is considered a lethal disease
causing death in thousands of people at the late stage of life. Dendropanax
morbifera Leveille is a subtropical broad-leaved prevalent species in Korea.
Extracts of the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of D. morbifera have been used in
traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases such as diabetes,
atherogenesis, skin disorders, and headaches. However, the anti-osteoporosis
effects of D. morbifera have not been examined. The primary objectives of this
study were to elucidate the anti-osteoporosis effect of D. morbifera extract
through an in vitro study using pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. We found that D.
morbifera strongly increased the expression of bone metabolic markers such as
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, type I collagen (Col-I) level, and
mineralization. Additionally, D. morbifera extract also upregulated the mRNA
expression levels of osteogenic genes including ALP, osteocalcin (OCN), osterix
(Osx), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in MC3T3-E1 cells via
upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)/p38 MAPK/JNK and Smad1/5/8
signaling pathways. Moreover, addition of D. morbifera significantly suppressed
the inhibitory effect of SB203580 (p38 inhibitor). In conclusion, the current
study demonstrated that D. morbifera extract significantly increased osteoblast
differentiation and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells by regulating BMP-2/p38/JNK 
and Smad1/5/8. Our study might be helpful in the discovery and development of new
anti-osteoporosis therapeutic agents.

Previous studies have indicated that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) can
promote the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and
increase bone formation in bone diseases. However, the mechanisms involved
remained poorly understood. It is necessary to investigate the specific
regulatory mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation that were induced by BMP9.
During the process of osteogenic differentiation induced by BMP9, the expression 
of microRNA-155 (miR-155) exhibited a tendency of increasing at first and then
decreasing, which made us consider that miR-155 may have a modulatory role in
this process, but the roles of this process have not been elucidated. This study 
aimed to uncover miR-155 capable of concomitant regulation of this process.
mmu-miR-155 mimic (miR-155) was transfected into MSCs and osteogenesis was
induction by using recombinant adenovirus expressing BMP9. Overexpressed miR-155 
in MSCs led to a decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and Alizarin red
S staining during osteogenic differentiation, and reduced the expression of
osteogenesis-related genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), 
osterix (OSX), osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN). On protein levels,
overexpressed miR-155 markedly decreased the expression of phosphorylated
Smad1/5/8 (p-Smad1/5/8), Runx2, OCN and OPN. Luciferase reporter assay revealed
Runx2 and bone morphogenetic protein receptor 9 (BMPR2) are two direct target
genes of miR-155. Downregulation of the expression of Runx2 and BMPR2,
respectively could offset the inhibitory effect of miR-155 in the osteogenesis of
MSCs. In vivo, subcutaneous ectopic osteogenesis of MSCs in nude mice showed
miR-155 inhibited osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion, our results
demonstrated that miR-155 can inhibit the osteogenic differentiation induced by
BMP9 in MSCs.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common type of rheumatoid disease, which has
recently been demonstrated to be associated with the expression of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. The aim of the present study was to investigate
whether MMP-2 interference reduced the osteogenic differentiation of fibroblasts 
and to explore the mechanism involved in the differentiation. Fibroblasts from
patients with AS were divided into control, mock and small interfering
(si)RNA-MMP-2 groups. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. mRNA and
protein expression levels of MMP-2, core-binding factor a1 (Cbfa-1) and bone
morphogenetic proteins/Smad-signalling molecules (BMP/Smad) were measured using
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western
blotting. The results indicated that cell viability and fibroblast morphology did
not differ significantly between healthy volunteers and patients with AS.
However, MMP-2 expression levels in AS fibroblasts were substantially higher.
MMP-2 gene silencing markedly downregulated the expression of MMP-2 and Cbfa-1,
and inhibitied the activation of the BMP/Smad signalling pathway consequent to
the reduction in levels of BMP-2, Smad1, Smad4 and Smad1/5/8. The results showed 
that MMP-2 gene silencing may reduce the osteogenesis of fibroblasts in AS by
inhibiting the activation of the BMP/Smad signalling pathway.

We proposed a three-step strategy to obtain the optimal therapeutic parameters,
which is composed of large-scale screening at cellular level, verification in
animal experiments, and confirmation by a clinical trial. The objective of the
current study was to test the feasibility of our strategy. Newborn rat calvarial 
osteoblasts were treated by 50 Hz 1.8 mT sinusoidal electromagnetic fields
(SEMFs) with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 h/days, respectively. The
osteogenic differentiation and maturation of the osteoblast were assayed and
compared to obtain the optimal duration. One-month-old growing rats were then
treated by the same SEMFs with 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 h/days, respectively, and the
peak bone mass was analyzed after 2 months. It was found that the optimal
exposure duration to promote the osteogenic differentiation and maturation of
osteoblasts was 1.5 h/days, judging by the increasing degrees of ALP activity,
calcified nodules formed, the gene and protein expression levels of Runx-2,
BMP-2, and Col-I, as well as the expression levels of signaling proteins of the
BMP-2/Smad1/5/8 pathway. The highest increase of peak bone mass after 2 months
was also obtained by 1.5 h/days, judging by the results of X-ray dual-energy
absorptiometry, mechanical property analysis, micro-CT scanning, and serum bone
turnover marker examinations. The above results indicated that exposure duration 
is a determinant for the therapeutic effect of EMFs, and the optimal therapeutic 
effects only can be obtained by the optimal exposure duration.

Certain microRNAs (miRs) have important roles in the maintenance of bone
development and metabolism, and a variety of miRs are known to be deregulated in 
diabetes. The present study investigated the role of miR‑203‑3p in the regulation
of bone loss by assessing jaw bones of a rat model of type 2 diabetes. The
results indicated that miR‑203‑3p inhibited osteogenesis in the jaws of diabetic 
rats and in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells cultured in high‑glucose
medium. A luciferase re-porter assay was used to verify the bioinformatics
prediction that miR‑203‑3p targets the 3'‑untranslated region of Smad1, which is 
an important mediator of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad pathway.
Overexpression of Smad1 attenuated the miR‑203‑3p‑mediated suppres-sion of
osteogenic differentiation. It was therefore indicated that the BMP/Smad pathway 
is attenuated and the transforming growth factor‑β/activin pathway is promoted by
Smad1 reduction. Taken together, it was indicated that miR‑203‑3p inhibits
osteogenesis in jaw bones of diabetic rats by targeting Smad1 to inhibit the
BMP/Smad pathway.

Although interaction between BMP and Notch signaling has been demonstrated to be 
crucial for osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the
precise molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that Notch
intracellular domain (NICD) overexpression inhibits BMP9-induced C3H10T1/2 cell
osteogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Our results show that activated Notch
signaling results in down-regulation of Runx2 and early osteogenesis
differentiation factors, without affecting p-Smad1/5/8 expression, and that
blocking Notch signaling with DAPT
(N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester)
significantly increases p-Smad1/5/8 expression. Interestingly, Notch signaling
also regulates the cell cycle by increasing PCNA (proliferation cell nuclear
antigen) and CyclinD1 expression. Furthermore, similar results were obtained by
ectopic bone formation and histological analyses, indicating that Notch signaling
activation significantly inhibits BMP9-induced MSC osteogenic, cartilage and
adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, we are the first to show that Notch
regulates by suppressing JunB synthesis and that the negative effect of Notch is 
partially reversed by treatment with the JunB activator TPA
(12-O-tetradeca-noylphorbol-13-acetate). Our findings demonstrate that Notch
signaling significantly enhances cell proliferation but inhibits MSC osteogenic
differentiation induced by BMP9 via JunB protein suppression rather than by
BMP/Smad signaling regulation.

Comment in
    Atherosclerosis. 2018 Mar;270:193-195.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent in vitro studies have showed that in macrophages,
deletion of the non-selective Ca2+-permeable channel TRPC3 impairs expression of 
the osteogenic protein BMP-2. The pathophysiological relevance of this effect in 
atherosclerotic plaque calcification remains to be determined.
METHODS: We used Ldlr-/- mice with macrophage-specific loss of TRPC3
(MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/-) to examine the effect of macrophage Trpc3 on plaque
calcification and osteogenic features in advanced atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: After 25 weeks on high fat diet, aortic root plaques in
MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice showed reduced size, lipid and macrophage content
compared to controls. Plaque calcification was decreased in MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/-
mice, and this was accompanied by marked reduction in BMP-2, Runx-2 and
phospho-SMAD1/5 contents within macrophage-rich areas. Expression of Bmp-2 and
Runx-2 was also reduced in bone marrow-derived macrophages from
MacTrpc3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that, in advanced atherosclerosis, selective
deletion of TRPC3 in macrophages favors plaque regression and impairs the
activity of a novel macrophage-associated, BMP-2-dependent mechanism of
calcification.

Estrogen deficiency results in an imbalance between the levels of bone-resorping 
osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts, eventually leading to overall bone
loss. Dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DHCA), a lignan compound originally isolated
from Cucurbita moschata, has been shown to bind to estrogen receptor, and indeed 
exhibits various activities of estrogen, such as anti-inflammatory and
anti-oxidative stress effects. In this study, we tested whether synthetic DHCA
could affect the BMP-2-induced osteoblastogenesis in vitro. In MC3T3-E1 cells,
DHCA promoted BMP-2-induced differentiation of osteoblasts. Consistently, the
expression of three osteoblastogenic genes known to be induced by BMP-2, ALP,
osteocalcin and OPG, was up-regulated by DHCA treatment. DHCA was also shown to
activate the production of RUNX2 by activating Smad1/5/9 and AMPK. Data from
transient transfection assays suggested that DHCA might activate the estrogen
receptor signaling pathway. Effects of DHCA on BMP-2-induced osteoblastogenesis
were reduced when cells were treated with a specific siRNA to ERα or ERβ. Taken
together, our results suggest that DHCA may be developed as an efficient
therapeutic for osteoporosis by regulating osteoblastogenesis through its
estrogenic effects.

The present study aimed to examine the mechanism of triptolide in the treatment
of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) through the anti‑ossification effect of bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)/small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) pathway.
Male rats were randomly divided into five groups: Normal rat group; model group; 
triptolide low dose group (10 mg/kg); triptolide middle dose group (20 mg/kg);
triptolide high dose group (40 mg/kg). The spinal joint capsules of each group of
rats were collected to perform primary cell culture to determine the levels of
cell proliferation. Western blot and reverse transcription‑polymerase chain
reaction analyses, and ELISA were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression 
levels of core‑binding factor α1 (Cbfal), BMP receptor type II (BMPRII), Smad1,
Smad4, Smad5 and Smad6, the protein expression of phosphorylation indicators,
including phosphorylated (p)Smad1 and pSmad5, the mRNA expression of tumor
necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6 in rat plasma, and the
mRNA expression of BMP/Smads in fibroblasts induced by recombinant human
(rh)BMP‑2. The effects on AS in the rats were also examined. The results revealed
that, following intervention with triptolide, inflammation was suppressed, and
the mRNA expression levels of TNF‑α, IL‑1β and IL‑6 were reduced. The expression 
levels of Cbfal, BMPRII, Smad1, Smad4 and Smad5 were also reduced, whereas the
expression of Smad6 was increased. Following induction by rhBMP‑2, the effects of
triptolide weakened, with the most marked effects observed at the highest
concentration, suggesting that triptolide functions through the BMP/Smad
signaling pathway. Taken together, the results suggested that triptolide may be
used to treat AS, the mechanism of which may be through the BMP/Smad pathway.

A bone-remodeling imbalance induced by increased bone resorption and osteoclast
formation causes skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. Induction of osteogenic 
differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) leads to bone regeneration. 
Many researchers have tried to develop new adjuvants as specific stimulators of
bone regeneration for therapeutic use in patients with bone resorption. We tried 
to develop a new adjuvant that has stronger osteogenic differentiation-promoting 
activity than bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In this study, we identified a 
new peptide, which we called bone-forming peptide (BFP)-3, derived from the
immature precursor of BMP-7. Upon osteogenic differentiation, BMSCs treated with 
BFP-3 exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization
ability and significantly up-regulated expression of osteogenic genes such as
ALP, osteocalcin (OC), Osterix, and Runx2 compared with control BMSCs.
Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence
analyses demonstrated that BFP-3 treatment up-regulated CD44 expression.
Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Smad1/5/8
phosphorylation was increased by BFP-3 treatment during osteogenic
differentiation. Furthermore, BFP-3-induced osteogenic differentiation was
significantly decreased by treatment with ERK1/2- and Smad-specific inhibitors.
These results suggest that BFP-3 plays an important role in regulating osteogenic
differentiation of BMSCs through increasing levels of osteogenic-inducing factors
and regulating the ERK1/2 and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways. Our finding indicates
that BFP-3 may be a potential new therapeutic target for promoting bone
formation.

Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by
mutations in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. However, 
little is known about how aberrant ERK signaling is associated with the defective
bone development manifested in most CFC syndrome patients. In this study, induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from dermal fibroblasts of a CFC
syndrome patient having rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase B (BRAF)
gain-of-function mutation. CFC-iPSCs were differentiated into mesenchymal stem
cells (CFC-MSCs) and further induced to osteoblasts in vitro. The osteogenic
defects of CFC-MSCs were revealed by alkaline phosphatase activity assay,
mineralization assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),
and western blotting. Osteogenesis of CFC-MSCs was attenuated compared to
wild-type (WT)-MSCs. In addition to activated ERK signaling, increased p-SMAD2
and decreased p-SMAD1 were observed in CFC-MSCs during osteogenesis. The
defective osteogenesis of CFC-MSCs was rescued by inhibition of ERK signaling and
SMAD2 signaling or activation of SMAD1 signaling. Importantly, activation of ERK 
signaling and SMAD2 signaling or inhibition of SMAD1 signaling recapitulated the 
impaired osteogenesis in WT-MSCs. Our findings indicate that SMAD2 signaling and 
SMAD1 signaling as well as ERK signaling are responsible for defective early bone
development in CFC syndrome, providing a novel insight on the pathological
mechanism and therapeutic targets.

Porphyromonas (P.) gingivalis infection leading to the periodontitis has been
associated with the development of systemic diseases, including cardiovascular
diseases and diabetes. However, the effect of a high concentration of glucose
(HG) on the invasion efficiency of P. gingivalis and the consequent modulation of
pathogenesis in vascular cells, especially in the vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs), remains unclear. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate whether
treating P. gingivalis with HG could change its invasion capability and result in
VSMC calcification and the underlying mechanism. Human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) and
P. gingivalis strain CCUG25226 were used in this study. We found that HGPg
infection of HASMCs could initiate the HASMC calcification by stimulating the
autocrine regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 in HASMCs. The
upregulation of BMP4 expression in HASMCs was mediated by toll-like receptor 4
and ERK1/2-p38 signaling after P. gingivalis infection. Moreover, the autocrine
action of BMP4 in HGPg infection-initiated HASMC calcification upregulated
BMP4-specific downstream smad1/5/8-runx2 signaling to increase the expressions of
bone-related matrix proteins, that is, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline
phosphatase. This study elucidates the detailed mechanism of HGPg
infection-initiated calcification of HASMCs and indicates a possible therapeutic 
role of BMP4 in P. gingivalis infection-associated vascular calcification.

Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) has been used clinically to encourage bone
regeneration; although, there can be major side effects with larger doses.
Therefore, there is a need to identify new small molecules to potentiate the
osteogenic action of BMP-2. In this study, we investigated the effect of mollugin
on bone formation in murine bi-potential mesenchymal progenitor C2C12 cells by
combination with BMP-2. We found mollugin could enhance the BMP-2-mediated
osteoblast differentiation of C2C12 cells. This was accompanied by the induction 
of other osteogenic BMPs. We also found the enhancing potential of mollugin may
involve activation of the p38-Smad1/5/8 signaling axis. Furthermore, mollugin
promoted skeletal development in zebrafish. The combination of BMP-2 with small
molecules, including mollugin, could minimize its clinical limitations, and these
molecules might lead to the development of effective stem cell stimulants for
bone regeneration and fracture healing.

Small-interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a rapid solution for drug design and
provides new methods to develop customizable medicines. Polyethyleneimine 25 kDa 
(PEI25kDa) is an effective transfection agent used in siRNA delivery. However,
the lack of degradable linkage causes undesirable toxicity, hindering its
clinical application. We designed a low-molecular-weight cross-linked
polyethylenimine named PEI-Et (Mn:1220, Mw:2895) by using degradable ethylene
biscarbamate linkage with lower cytotoxicity and higher knockdown efficiency than
PEI25kDa in delivery Chordin siRNA to human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs).
Suppression of Chordin by using anti-Chordin siRNA delivered by PEI-Et improved
bone regeneration in vitro and in vivo associated with the bone morphogenetic
protein-2 (BMP-2) mediated smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. Results of this study
suggest that Chordin siRNA can be potentially used to improve osteogenesis
associated with the BMP-2-mediated Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway and biodegradable 
biscarbamate cross-linked low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine (PEI-Et) is a
therapeutically feasible carrier material to deliver anti-Chordin siRNA to
hBMSCs.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of mechanical stress 
on the osteogenic differentiation of human ligamentum flavum cells via the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)‑Smad1 signaling pathway. Mechanical stress increased 
cell proliferation and induced osteogenic differentiation of human cells derived 
from the ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF). In addition, mechanical
stress activated osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and runt‑related
transcription factor 2 (RUNX‑2) mRNA expression, and suppressed Ets
proto‑oncogene 1 (Ets‑1) and sex determining region Y‑box 2 (SOX‑2) mRNA
expression in OLF cells. Src protein expression was suppressed by mechanical
stress in human OLF cells. In addition, the protein expression levels of BMP,
phosphorylated (p)‑mothers against decapentaplegic homolog‑1 (Smad1) and
p‑p38‑mitogen‑activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) were increased by mechanical
stress. These results demonstrate that mechanical stress effectively increases
cell proliferation, promotes the osteogenic differentiation rate of OLF cells,
activates OC, ALP and RUNX‑2, and suppresses Ets‑1 and SOX‑2 potentially via the 
BMP‑Smad1 and Src‑p38MAPK signaling pathways.

Recent studies indicate that Family with sequence similarity 20 member C (FAM20C)
catalyzes the phosphorylation of secreted proteins, and participates in a variety
of biological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, mineralization,
and phosphate homeostasis. To explore the local influences of FAM20C on
osteoblast, Fam20c-deficient osteoblasts were generated by treating the
immortalized Fam20cf/f osteoblasts with CMV-Cre-IRES-EGFP lentivirus. Compared
with the normal Fam20cf/f osteoblasts, the expression of Bone sialoprotein (Bsp),
Osteocalcin (Ocn), Fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23), and transcription factors
that promote osteoblast maturation were up-regulated in the Fam20c-deficient
osteoblasts. In contrast, the expression of Dental matrix protein 1 (Dmp1),
Dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), Osteopontin (Opn), type I Collagen a 1
(Col1a1), and Alkine phosphatase (Alp) were down-regulated in the
Fam20c-deficient cells. These alterations disclosed the primary regulation of
Fam20c on gene expression. The Fam20c-deficient osteoblasts showed a remarkable
reduction in the ability of forming mineralized nodules. However, supplements of 
extracellular matrix proteins extracted from the normal bone failed to rescue the
reduced mineralization, suggesting that FAM20C may affect the biomineralization
by the means more than local phosphorylation of extracellular matrix proteins and
systemic phosphorus homeostasis. Moreover, although Fam20c deficiency had little 
impact on cell proliferation, it significantly reduced cell migration and lowered
the levels of p-Smad1/5/8, p-Erk and p-p38, suggesting that the kinase activity
of FAM20C might be essential to cell mobility and the activity of BMP ligands. In
summary, these findings provide evidences that FAM20C may regulate osteoblast
maturation, migration, mineralization, and BMP signaling pathways in a
cell-autonomous manner.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity and diabetes potentiate vascular calcification by
increasing vascular smooth muscle cells osteoblastic differentiation mediated by 
the transcription factor Msx2 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 signaling.
However, Bmp-2/Msx2 crosstalk to induce VSMC osteogenic phenotype transition and 
calcification is poorly understood in diabetes. We aimed to investigate
mechanisms underlying Bmp-2-driven VSMC osteogenic differentiation and
calcification in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice.
METHODS: We incubated VSMC from ob/ob mice and wild type C57BL/6 littermates with
or without Bmp-2. We used loss-of-function experiments to investigate the role of
Msx2 in Bmp-2-induced ob/ob VSMC osteochondrogenic differentiation and
calcification by transfecting Msx2 siRNA into VSMC.
RESULTS: Baseline ob/ob VSMC and aorta showed increased Msx2, Runx2, alkaline
phosphatase mRNA and protein expression, which further increased in
Bmp-2-incubated ob/ob VSMC, therefore augmenting ob/ob VSMC calcification in
comparison to wild type VSMC. Accordingly, signaling pathways to induce VSMC
osteogenic differentiation, such as Smad1/5 phosphorylation increased in ob/ob
versus wild type aorta. In comparison to wild type VSMC, Msx2 siRNA transfected
VSMC decreased Bmp-2-dependent osteochondrogenic differentiation response by
abrogating Msx2, Runx2, Alpl expression in ob/ob but not in wild type VSMC.
Nonetheless, Msx2 inhibition did not decrease calcification in Bmp-2 stimulated
ob/ob VSMC in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a crucial role of Msx2 for ob/ob VSMC
osteochondrogenic differentiation, however, Msx2 signaling alone is not
sufficient for ob/ob VSMC calcification after Bmp-2 stimulation in vitro. These
findings can be translated into novel perspectives for the understanding of the
mechanisms and to provide therapeutic targets underlying vascular calcification
in type 2 diabetes.

Osteoblast differentiation is regulated through the successive activation of
signaling molecules by a complex interplay of extracellular signals such as bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt ligands. Numerous studies have identified
natural as well as synthetic compounds with osteogenic activity through the
regulation of either BMP/SMADs or the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we attempted
to isolate small molecules that concurrently activated both SMADs and β-catenin, 
which led to the discovery of a novel potent osteogenic compound, DMP-PYT. Upon
BMP2 stimulation, DMP-PYT substantially increased osteoblast differentiation
featured by enhanced expression of osteoblast-specific genes and accelerated
calcification through activation of BMPs expression. DMP-PYT promoted
BMP2-induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and β-catenin expression, the latter in a 
BMP2-independent manner. DMP-PYT alone enhanced nuclear localization of β-catenin
to promote the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of T-cell factor, thereby
resulting in increased osteoblast differentiation in the absence of BMP2. Most
importantly, DMP-PYT advanced skeletal development and bone calcification in
zebrafish larvae. Conclusively, DMP-PYT strongly stimulated osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation in vitro and in vivo by potentiating
BMP2-induced activation of SMADs and β-catenin. These results suggest that
DMP-PYT may have beneficial effects for preventing and for treating osteoporosis.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play vital roles in regulating stem cell
maintenance, differentiation and embryonic development. Intracellularly, BMP
signalling is mediated by Smad proteins, which are regulated
post-transcriptionally through reversible phosphorylation and ubiquitination.
ZC4H2 is a small nuclear protein associated with intellectual disability and
neural development in humans. Here, we report that ZC4H2 is highly expressed in
the developing neural system and is involved in neural patterning and BMP
signalling in Xenopus Knockdown of ZC4H2 led to expansion of the expression of
the pan neural plate marker Sox2 in Xenopus embryos. In mammalian cells, ZC4H2
promotes BMP signalling and is involved in BMP regulated myogenic and osteogenic 
differentiation of mouse myoblast cells. Mechanistically, ZC4H2 binds and
stabilizes Smad1 and Smad5 proteins through reducing their association with the
Smurf ubiquitin ligases and thus their ubiquitination. We also found that a group
of ZC4H2 mutations, which have been isolated in patients with intellectual
disorders, showed weaker Smad-stabilizing activity, suggesting that the
ZC4H2-Smad interaction might contribute to proper neural development in humans.

Here, we describe three new small-molecule activators of BMP signaling found by
high throughput screening of a library of ∼600 000 small molecules. Using a
cell-based luciferase assay in the BMP4-responsive human cervical carcinoma
clonal cell line, C33A-2D2, we identified three compounds with similar chemotypes
that each ventralize zebrafish embryos and stimulate increased expression of the 
BMP target genes, bmp2b and szl. Because these compounds ventralize zebrafish
embryos, we have termed them "ventromorphins." As expected for a BMP pathway
activator, they induce the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to osteoblasts.
Affymetrix RNA analysis confirmed the differentiation results and showed that
ventromorphins treatment elicits a genetic response similar to BMP4 treatment.
Unlike isoliquiritigenin (SJ000286237), a flavone that maximally activates the
pathway after 24 h of treatment, all three ventromorphins induced SMAD1/5/8
phosphorylation within 30 min of treatment and achieved peak activity within 1 h,
indicating that their responses are consistent with directly activating BMP
signaling.

Cells, scaffolds, and growth factors play important roles in bone regeneration.
Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a member of BMP family, could facilitate
osteogenesis by regulating growth factors and promoting angiogenesis. Similar to 
other stem cells, rat dental follicle stem cells (rDFCs), the precursor cells of 
cementoblasts, osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells, can self-renew and
exhibit multipotential capacity. Coralline hydroxyapatite (CHA) has good
biocompatibility and conductivity required for bone tissue engineering. Here, we 
reported that BMP9 could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of rDFCs in cell 
culture. Moreover, our results suggested that BMP9 acted through the Smad1/5/8
signaling pathway. We also produced a novel scaffold that encompasses
bio-degradable CHA seeded with recombinant adenoviruses expressing
BMP9-transfected rDFCs (Ad-BMP9-transfected rDFCs). With this implant, we
achieved more alveolar bone regeneration in the alveolar bone defect compared to 
blank group, CHA group and rDFCs group. Our results provided a novel bio-implants
composed of Ad-BMP9-transfected rDFCs and CHA scaffolds and its mechanism is
regarding the activation of Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway in BMP9-induced rDFCs
osteogenesis.

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is one of the most frequently used
osteogenic factors for osteogenesis. Macrophages, acting as both immune cells and
osteoclast precursors, have an indispensable functional input during multiple
stages of bone healing. This study aims to investigate the immunoregulatory role 
of BMP-2 on macrophages and the subsequent effects on osteogenesis. In the
subcutaneous implantation study, gelatin sponge incorporated with 20 μg/mL BMP-2 
rendered significantly enhanced macrophage infiltration compared with the gelatin
sponge control. Further in vitro study using murine macrophage cell line has
shown that BMP-2 could function as a potent attractant for macrophage
recruitment. The supplementation of BMP-2 dramatically diminished the expression 
of M1 phenotypic markers, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and iNOS in M1
polarized macrophages, indicating a positive immunoregulatory role of BMP-2 under
inflammatory status. In addition, BMP-2 alone could robustly activate macrophages
through pSmad1/5/8 signaling pathway and generate a positive feedback loop by
increasing the expression of angiogenic factors. Conditioned medium collected
from BMP2-stimulated macrophages accelerated the osteogenic differentiation of
bone marrow stromal cells. Our finding suggests that BMP-2-induced osteogenesis
may also involve the regulation of the local osteoimmune environment. The
positive effect of BMP-2 on regulating immune response makes it possible to
utilize the immunomodulatory properties of BMP-2 to manipulate the osteoimmune
environment for favorable bone regeneration.

Mechanisms mediating vascular calcification recapitulate osteogenic processes
encompassing bone formation and imply participation of bone related proteins such
as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Macrophages are amongst the cells that
contribute to vascular ossification by releasing cytokines that induce an
osteogenic program in vascular smooth muscle cells, and also by becoming
themselves osteoclast-like cells. In inflammatory vascular disease, the
macrophage population in the vascular wall is diverse, with the M1 or
inflammatory, and the M2 or anti-inflammatory macrophage types being dominant.
Yet, the osteogenic potential of M1 and M2 macrophages remains unknown. Prompted 
by recent studies from our laboratory showing that in macrophages the Transient
Receptor Potential Canonical 3 (TRPC3) channel contributes to endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in M1, but not in M2 macrophages, and
given the strong relationship between ER stress and vascular calcification, we
wished to examine whether TRPC3 would play a role in the osteogenic signaling of 
polarized macrophages. The findings reported here indicate that a constitutive
BMP-2-dependent signaling operates in M1 macrophages, which is not affected by
deletion of Trpc3 and is not subject to regulation by ER stress. Our studies
suggest operation of an auto/paracrine mechanism by which BMP-2 secreted by M1
macrophages maintains constitutive activation of a BMP-2 receptor/SMAD1/5
signaling axis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Cx43- 
and Smad-mediated TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway on the differentiation of bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into cartilage and inhibition of
ossification.
METHODS: BMSCs of Wistar rats were cultured and assigned into 5 groups for
transfection with adenoviruses. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to detect mRNA and protein
expressions of target genes. The condition of cartilage and ossification were
measured by a series of staining methods. Subcutaneous injection of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) into nude rats was performed.
RESULTS: After transfection, compared to the AdGFP group, the corresponding
target mRNAs were overexpressed in the AdBMP2, AdSmad1, AdCx43 + AdSmad1 and
AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups, and overexpression of BMP2 at the mRNA and
protein expression was observed in the AdSmad1 and AdCx43 + AdSmad1 groups. The
mRNA expressions of aggrecan (ACAN) and collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1), the
glycosaminoglycan content of the extracellular matrix and the expression of type 
II collagen, Col2a1, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC) were higher in the
AdBMP2, AdSmad1, AdCx43 + AdSmad1 and AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups than in
the AdGFP group; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mRNA and protein
expressions of Runx2 were also higher in these groups than in the AdGFP group.
Heterotopic osteogenesis tests demonstrated evident cartilage differentiation
ability in the AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups. In comparison, the AdCx43 +
AdSmad1 and AdSmad1 groups exhibited weaker cartilage differentiation abilities.
CONCLUSION: Cx43 and Smad1 promote BMP-induced cartilage differentiation of BMSCs
and inhibit osteoblast differentiation, which provide a new strategy for
cartilage tissue engineering using exogenous Cx43 and Smad1.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain
tumor, characterized by the intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy due to the
presence of a highly aggressive Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) sub-population. In this
context, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) have been demonstrated to induce CSC 
differentiation and to sensitize GBM cells to treatments.
METHODS: The BMP-2 mimicking peptide, named GBMP1a, was synthesized on
solid-phase by Fmoc chemistry. Structural characterization and prediction of
receptor binding were obtained by Circular Dicroism (CD) and NRM analyses.
Activation of BMP signalling was evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay and
western blot. Pro-differentiating effects of GBMP1a were verified by
immunostaining and neurosphere assay in primary glioblastoma cultures.
RESULTS: CD and NMR showed that GBMP1a correctly folds into expected
tridimensional structures and predicted its binding to BMPR-IA to the same
epitope as in the native complex. Reporter analysis disclosed that GBMP1a is able
to activate BMP signalling in GBM cells. Moreover, BMP-signalling activation was 
specifically dependent on smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. Finally, we confirmed that
GBMP1a treatment is sufficient to enhance osteogenic differentiation of
Mesenchymal Stem Cells and to induce astroglial differentiation of glioma stem
cells (GSCs) in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: GBMP1a was demonstrated to be a good inducer of GSC differentiation,
thus being considered a potential anti-cancer tool to be further developed for
GBM treatment.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These data highlight the role of BMP-mimicking peptides as 
potential anti-cancer agents against GBM and stimulate the further development of
GBMP1a-based structures in order to enhance its stability and activity.

Obsjective:To investigate the effects of differentaction time of IL-1β on the
osteogenic capacity of bone marrow mensenchymal cells(BMMSC) and the role of
nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) pathway.METHODS: BMMSC isolated from normal donors was 
treated with IL-1β for 1 or 7 days, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 
alizarin red(AR) stainings were used to detect the osteogenic differentiation
potential of BMMSC. The mRNA expression of EphB4, IGF-1 and OPG in BMMSC was
measured by real-time PCR. The immunohistochemistry was employed to measure the
expression of bone morphgenetic protein-2(BMP-2) and p-Smad1/5/8 in BMMSC.
Furthermore, the Western blot was used for the detection of iκBα and phospho-iκBα
(p-ikBα) in IL-1β-treated BMMSC. And the results of IL-1β-treated BMMSC were
compared with control group.
RESULTS: Compared with control group, the osteogenetic potential of IL-1β-treated
BMMSC was enhanced, but the pro-osteogenic differentiation effect of IL-1β was
remarkedly inhibited in the presence of NF-kB pathway inhibitor PDTC. The total
ikBα level of IL-1β-treated BMMSC was lower (P<0.05), and phospho-iκBα (p-iκBα)
level was higher (P<0.05). Besides, BMP-2 expression was higher (P<0.05) in the
IL-1β-treated BMMSC, however, p-Smad1/5/8 protien level was not significantly
different among IL-1β-treated for 1 d, 7 d and control groups (P<0.05). And the
mRNA expression levels of IGF-1, EphB4 and OPG in BMMSC were up-regulated after
IL-1β treatment (P<0.05). In addition, the osteoblastogenesis of BMMSC treated
with IL-1β for 7 days was significantly different from those treated only for 1
day.
CONCLUSION: Prolonging IL-1β treatment can enhance the osteogenetic
differentiation of BMMSC more significantly. And this osteogenetic alteration of 
BMMSC occurs via its NF-κB pathway, but not via BMP-2/Smad pathway.

Understanding the molecular events that regulate osteoblast differentiation is
essential for the development of effective approaches to bone regeneration. In
this study, we analysed the osteoinductive properties of extracellular calcium in
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) differentiation. We cultured
BM-MSCs in 3D gelatin scaffolds with Ca2+ and BMP-2 as osteoinductive agents.
Early and late osteogenic gene expression and bone regeneration in a calvarial
critical-size defect model demonstrate that extracellular Ca2+ enhances the
effects of BMP-2 on Osteocalcin, Runx2 and Osterix expression and promotes bone
regeneration in vivo. Moreover, we analysed the molecular mechanisms involved and
observed an antagonistic effect between Ca2+ and BMP-2 on SMAD1/5, ERK and S6K
signalling after 24 hours. More importantly, a cooperative effect between Ca2+
and BMP-2 on the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5, S6, GSK3 and total levels of
β-CATENIN was observed at a later differentiation time (10 days). Furthermore,
Ca2+ alone favoured the phosphorylation of SMAD1, which correlates with the
induction of Bmp2 and Bmp4 gene expression. These data suggest that Ca2+ and
BMP-2 cooperate and promote an autocrine/paracrine osteogenic feed-forward loop. 
On the whole, these results demonstrate the usefulness of calcium-based bone
grafts or the addition of exogenous Ca2+ in bone tissue engineering.

High incidence of osteoporotic fractures emphasizes the necessity of developing
effective measures to promote osteogenesis. In our study, we investigated a
possible role of MAPK-ERK signaling in the TGF-β-mediated osteoblastic
differentiation. Our results indicated that TGF-β activated the MAPK-ERK pathway 
and inhibited osteogenesis in mesenchymal pluripotent cell line, C3H10T1/2, and
preosteoblastic cell line, MC3T3 cells. And the downregulation of MAPK-ERK
signaling using pharmacological inhibitor U0126 and RNA interference rescued
osteoblast differentiation suppressed by TGF-β, which was confirmed by Alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) staining and alizarrn red staining, and the enhanced expression
of osteogenesic markers. Western blotting analysis indicated that TGF-β induced
protein expression of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SMURF1, which contributed to
the degradation of RUNX2 and SMAD1 as evidenced by SMURF1 inhibition using RNA
interference and proteasome inhibitor MG132. Moreover, we observed that the
expression of SMURF1 was decreased, while that of SMAD1 and RUNX2 increased by
MAPK-ERK inhibitor U0126 in TGF-β-treated differentiating preosteoblasts,
suggesting that MAPK-ERK regulated the transcription of osteogenesis-related
genes. Furthermore, a synergistic effect between U0126 and bone morphogenic
protein (BMP)-2 on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation was observed
both in cell cultures and experimental animals. In conclusion, our results
revealed that TGF-β inhibited osteoblastic differentiation by inducing the
MAPK-ERK pathway which upregulated the expression of ubiquitin ligase SMURF1 and 
resulted in reduced presence of osteogenic proteins. In addition, the
potentiation of BMP-2 on osteogenic activity by ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 suggests
that it may have potential clinical utility for promoting osteogenesis in bone
fracture repair.

The underlying mechanism of the reduced bone formation during the development of 
glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) remains unclear. Here, we found that
the highly expressed CKIP-1 together with lowly expressed total and
phosphorylated Smad1/5 in bone samples was accompanied by either the reduced
serum bone formation markers in GIO patients or the decreased bone formation in
GIO mice. In vitro studies showed that the highly expressed CKIP-1 could promote 
Smad1 ubiquitination to suppress the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and inhibit
osteogenic differentiation and mineral deposition in MC3T3-E1 cells during
glucocorticoid treatment. Further, the reduced bone formation in GIO mice could
not only be prevented by osteoblasts-specific Ckip-1 ablation, but also be
attenuated after osteoblasts-specific Smad1 overexpression. Moreover,
osteoblasts-targeting CKIP-1 siRNA treatment also attenuated the bone formation
reduction in GIO mice. These study suggest that the highly expressed CKIP-1 in
osteoblasts could suppress the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and contribute to the
bone formation reduction in GIO. Targeting osteoblastic CKIP-1 would be a novel
bone anabolic strategy for GIO patients.

Focal adipose deficiency, such as lipoatrophy, lumpectomy or facial trauma, is a 
formidable challenge in reconstructive medicine, and yet scarcely investigated in
experimental studies. Here, we report that Pyrintegrin (Ptn), a 2,4-disubstituted
pyrimidine known to promote embryonic stem cells survival, is robustly adipogenic
and induces postnatal adipose tissue formation in vivo of transplanted adipose
stem/progenitor cells (ASCs) and recruited endogenous cells. In vitro, Ptn
stimulated human adipose tissue derived ASCs to differentiate into lipid-laden
adipocytes by upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) and
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), with differentiated cells increasingly
secreting adiponectin, leptin, glycerol and total triglycerides. Ptn-primed human
ASCs seeded in 3D-bioprinted biomaterial scaffolds yielded newly formed adipose
tissue that expressed human PPARγ, when transplanted into the dorsum of athymic
mice. Remarkably, Ptn-adsorbed 3D scaffolds implanted in the inguinal fat pad had
enhanced adipose tissue formation, suggesting Ptn's ability to induce in situ
adipogenesis of endogenous cells. Ptn promoted adipogenesis by upregulating PPARγ
and C/EBPα not only in adipogenesis induction medium, but also in chemically
defined medium specifically for osteogenesis, and concurrently attenuated Runx2
and Osx via BMP-mediated SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. These findings suggest Ptn's
novel role as an adipogenesis inducer with a therapeutic potential in soft tissue
reconstruction and augmentation.

Europium-doped Gd2O3 nanotubes (Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs) have been extensively applied in 
the field of bioscience for their photostability and magnetic properties.
Nevertheless, the distribution and interaction between Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs and
metabolism of bone are not yet sufficiently understood. In this study, a
systematic study of the toxicity and distribution of Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs in mice after
oral administration was carried out. The results showed that a small number of
the Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs could pass through biological barriers into the lung, liver,
and spleen, but a high concentration was observed in bone. Furthermore, the
effects of Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs on bone metabolism were systematically studied in vitro
and in vivo when accumulating in bone. After being administered to mice, the
Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs extremely enhanced the bone mineral density and bone biomechanics.
In vitro the Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs increased the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and
mineralization and promoted the expression of osteogenesis genes in
preosteoblasts MC3T3-E1 through activation of the BMP signaling pathway. This
study will be significant for appropriate application of Gd2O3:Eu3+ NTs in the
biomedical field and expounding the molecular mechanism of bone metabolism.

Emerging evidence indicates that the dysregulation of protein ubiquitination
plays a crucial role in aging-associated diseases. Smad-dependent canonical BMP
signaling pathway is indispensable for osteoblastic bone formation, which could
be disrupted by the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of
Smad1/5, the key molecules for BMP signaling transduction. However, whether the
dysregulation of Smad1/5 ubiquitination and disrupted BMP signaling pathway is
responsible for the age-related bone formation reduction is still underexplored. 
Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1 (PLEKHO1) is a previously
identified ubiquitination-related molecule that could specifically target the
linker region between the WW domains of Smurf1 to promote the ubiquitination of
Smad1/5. Here, we found an age-related increase in the expression of PLEKHO1 in
bone specimens from either fractured patients or aging rodents, which was
associated with the age-related reduction in Smad-dependent BMP signaling and
bone formation. By genetic approach, we demonstrated that loss of Plekho1 in
osteoblasts could promote the Smad-dependent BMP signaling and alleviated the
age-related bone formation reduction. In addition, osteoblast-specific Smad1
overexpression had beneficial effect on bone formation during aging, which could 
be counteracted after overexpressing Plekho1 within osteoblasts. By
pharmacological approach, we showed that osteoblast-targeted Plekho1 siRNA
treatment could enhance Smad-dependent BMP signaling and promote bone formation
in aging rodents. Taken together, it suggests that the increased PLEKHO1 could
suppress Smad-dependent BMP signaling to inhibit bone formation during aging,
indicating the translational potential of targeting PLEKHO1 in osteoblast as a
novel bone anabolic strategy for reversing established osteoporosis during aging.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP)-related fractures usually result in morbidity 
and mortality in aging women, so it remains a global public health concern, and
new effective safe treatments are urgently needed recently. Efficient
osteogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would have the clinical
application potential in treating multiple osteal disorders. Follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), a pituitary glycoprotein hormone highly associated with menopausal
bone turnover, whose peculiar part of receptor binding is follicle-stimulating
hormone β-subunit (FSHβ). Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a potent
osteogenic factor, can up-regulate FSHβ in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).
However, it is unclear, whether extrapituitary FSHβ affects BMP9-induced
osteogenesis in MEFs. In this study, we investigated the role of FSHβ in
BMP9-induced osteogenesis in MEFs. We found that exogenous expression of FSHβ
significantly increased BMP9-induced alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), the
expression of osteogenic transcriptional factors, Runx2 and Osx, and the
established late osteogenic markers, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN), so 
does the ectopic bone formation. Mechanistically, FSHβ dramatically enhanced
BMP9-induced BMP/Smad signal transduction, presenting the augment phosphorylation
of Smad1/5/8, whereas treatment with anti-FSHβ antibodies suppressed these
effects. An adenylate cyclase inhibitor obviously suppressed ALP and BMP/Smad
signal transduction induced by BMP9 or the combination of BMP9 and FSHβ in MEFs. 
Collectively, our findings suggested that FSHβ may promote BMP9-induced
activation of BMP/Smad signaling through a FSH/FSH receptor (FSHR)/cAMP dependent
pathway in MEFs partly. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1792-1802, 2017. © 2016 Wiley

We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator/repressor
interferon-related developmental regulator 1 (Ifrd1) was expressed in osteoblasts
and participated in the regulation of bone homeostasis. However, it remains
unclear how Ifrd1 expression itself is regulated in osteoblasts. In the present
study, we investigated the upstream regulatory mechanisms of Ifrd1 in osteoblasts
during osteoblastogenesis. Ifrd1 protein expression and runt-related
transcription factor 2, the master regulator of osteoblastogenesis, were markedly
upregulated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) stimulation in primary
osteoblasts. Moreover, BMP-2 stimulation significantly induced Ifrd1 mRNA
expression and promoter activity in osteoblasts. LDN193189, an inhibitor of
activin-like kinase 2/3, almost completely inhibited the BMP-2-induced increase
in Ifrd1 protein expression. There were at least two putative Smad-binding
elements in the 5'-flanking region, which was highly conserved between mouse and 
human Ifrd1 genes. Co-introduction of both Smad4 and Smad1 significantly
increased Ifrd1 promoter activity in osteoblasts. In addition, BMP-2 induced the 
recruitment of Smad1 to the Ifrd1 promoter in osteoblasts. Moreover,
BMP-2-dependent osteoblastogenesis was further enhanced in Ifrd1 knocked-down
osteoblasts, as determined by the intensity of Alizarin red stain and marker gene
expression. These results suggest that BMP-2 directly induces Ifrd1 expression at
the transcriptional level in osteoblasts via the Smad pathway, and Ifrd1
negatively regulates BMP-2-dependent osteoblastogenesis.

Proteins of the transforming-growth-factor-β (TGF-β)-superfamily have a
remarkable ability to induce cartilage and bone and the crosstalk of TGF-β - and 
BMP-signalling pathways appears crucial during chondrocyte development. Aim was
to assess the regulation of TGF-β-superfamily members and of Smad2/3- and
Smad1/5/9-signalling during endochondral in vitro chondrogenesis of mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSC) relative to chondral redifferentiation of articular
chondrocytes (AC) to adjust chondrocyte development of MSC towards a less
hypertrophic phenotype. While MSC increased BMP4 and BMP7 and reduced TGFBR2 and 
TGFBR3-expression during chondrogenesis, an opposite regulation was observed
during AC-redifferentiation. Antagonists CHRD and CHL2 rose significantly only in
AC-cultures. AC showed higher initial BMP4, pSmad1/5/9 and SOX9 protein levels, a
faster (re-)differentiation but a similar decline of pSmad2/3- and
pSmad1/5/9-signalling versus MSC-cultures. BMP-4/7-stimulation of MSC-pellets
enhanced SOX9 and accelerated ALP-induction but did not shift differentiation
towards osteogenesis. Inhibition of BMP-signalling by dorsomorphin significantly 
reduced SOX9, raised RUNX2, maintained collagen-type-II and collagen-type-X lower
and kept ALP-activity at levels reached at initiation of treatment. Conclusively,
ALK1,2,3,6-signalling was essential for MSC-chondrogenesis and its
prochondrogenic rather than prohypertrophic role may explain why inhibition of
canonical BMP-signalling could not uncouple cartilage matrix production from
hypertrophy as this was achieved with pulsed PTHrP-application.

Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) have been considered as a potential
candidate for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, however, the
mechanism of its action is still elusive. We have previously reported that 50Hz
0.6mT PEMFs stimulate osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization in a
primary cilium- dependent manner, but did not know the reason. In the current
study, we found that the PEMFs promoted osteogenic differentiation and maturation
of rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) by activating bone morphogenetic protein
BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling on the condition that primary cilia were normal. Further 
studies revealed that BMPRII, the primary binding receptor of BMP ligand, was
readily and strongly upregulated by PEMF treatment and localized at the bases of 
primary cilia. Abrogation of primary cilia with small interfering RNA sequence
targeting IFT88 abolished the PEMF-induced upregulation of BMPRII and its ciliary
localization. Knockdown of BMPRII expression level with RNA interference had no
effects on primary cilia but significantly decreased the promoting effect of
PEMFs on osteoblastic differentiation and maturation. These results indicated
that PEMFs stimulate osteogenic differentiation and maturation of osteoblast by
primary cilium-mediated upregulation of BMPRII expression and subsequently
activation of BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling, and that BMPRII is the key component
linking primary cilium and BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathway. This study has thus revealed
the molecular mechanism for the osteogenic effect of PEMFs.

Perturbations in skeletal development and bone degeneration may result in reduced
bone mass and quality, leading to greater fracture risk. Bone loss is mitigated
by bone protective therapies, but there is a clinical need for new bone-anabolic 
agents. Previous work has demonstrated that Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), a
histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase, suppressed differentiation of
osteogenic progenitors. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of Ezh2 can be
leveraged for bone stimulatory applications. Pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA
knockdown of Ezh2 enhanced osteogenic commitment of MC3T3 preosteoblasts. Next
generation RNA sequencing of mRNAs and real time quantitative PCR profiling
established that Ezh2 inactivation promotes expression of bone-related gene
regulators and extracellular matrix proteins. Mechanistically, enhanced gene
expression was linked to decreased H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) near
transcriptional start sites in genome-wide sequencing of chromatin
immunoprecipitations assays. Administration of an Ezh2 inhibitor modestly
increases bone density parameters of adult mice. Furthermore, Ezh2 inhibition
also alleviated bone loss in an estrogen-deficient mammalian model for
osteoporosis. Ezh2 inhibition enhanced expression of Wnt10b and Pth1r and
increased the BMP-dependent phosphorylation of Smad1/5. Thus, these data suggest 
that inhibition of Ezh2 promotes paracrine signaling in osteoblasts and has
bone-anabolic and osteoprotective potential in adults.

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key regulators of diverse cellular
activities by regulating the expression of protein-coding genes. Osteoblast
differentiation, a fundamental step in skeletal development, involves the
activation of several signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor β 
(TGF-β), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and Wnt signaling pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: miRNA expression was measured using TaqManRT-PCR. Western 
blot was used to detect the protein expression of Smad1. Luciferase reporter
assay was used to measure the luciferase activity.
RESULTS: In this study, we found that miR-100 was expressed in mesenchymal
progenitor cell lines; furthermore, its expression was reduced during osteoblast 
differentiation. Retroviral overexpression of miR-100 decreased Smad1 protein
levels, whereas miR-100 inhibition had the opposite effect, suggesting that
miR-100 acts as an endogenous attenuator of Smad1 in osteoblast differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data demonstrate that miR-100 acts as an important
endogenous negative regulator of BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation.

Although sulfuretin, the major flavonoid of Rhus verniciflua Stokes, has a
variety of biological actions, its in vitro and in vivo effects on osteogenic
potential remain poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to
investigate the effects of sulfuretin on in vitro osteoblastic differentiation
and the underlying signal pathway mechanisms in primary cultured osteoblasts and 
on in vivo bone formation using critical-sized calvarial defects in mice.
Sulfuretin promoted osteogenic differentiation of primary osteoblasts, with
increased ALP activity and mineralization, and upregulated differentiation
markers, including ALP, osteocalcin, and osteopontin, in a
concentration-dependent manner. The expression levels of Runx2, BMP-2, and
phospho-Smad1/5/8 were upregulated by sulfuretin. Moreover, sulfuretin increased 
phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, ERK, and JNK. Furthermore, sulfuretin treatment
increased mRNA expression of Wnt ligands, phosphorylation of GSK3, and nuclear
β-catenin protein expression. In vivo studies with calvarial bone defects
revealed that sulfuretin significantly enhanced new bone formation by
micro-computed tomography and histologic analysis. Collectively, these data
suggest that sulfuretin acts through the activation of BMP, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, 
and Runx2 signaling to promote in vitro osteoblast differentiation and facilitate
in vivo bone regeneration, and might be have therapeutic benefits in bone disease
and regeneration.

Providing an osteogenic stimulatory environment is a key strategy to construct
stem cell-based bone-equivalent tissues. Here we design a stem cell delivering
gel matrix made of collagen (Col) with bioactive glass nanocarriers (BGn) that
incorporate osteogenic signaling molecule, fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18), a
reservoir considered to cultivate and promote osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs). The presence of BGn in the gel was shown to enhance the osteogenic 
differentiation of MSCs, possibly due to the therapeutic role of ions released.
The mesoporous nature of BGn was effective in loading FGF18 at large quantity,
and the FGF18 release from the BGn-Col gel matrix was highly sustainable with
almost a zero-order kinetics, over 4 weeks as confirmed by the green fluorescence
protein signal change. The released FGF18 was effective in accelerating
osteogenesis (alkaline phosphatase activity and bone related gene expressions)
and bone matrix formation (osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin
production) of MSCs. This was attributed to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 
signaling pathway, where the FGF18 release stimulated the endogenous secretion of
BMP2 and the downstream signal Smad1/5/8. Taken together, the FGF18-BGn/Col gel
is considered an excellent osteopromoting depot to support and signal MSCs for
bone tissue engineering.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great therapeutic potential due to their
abilities to self-renewal and their potential for differentiating into a variety 
of cell lineages. However, how to improve the differentiation efficiency of MSC
into osteoblast remains a big challenge in the field of bone regenerative
medicine. In current study, we identified a role of CHD7 in osteogenic
differentiation of MSC. We showed that CHD7 expression in MSC could be induced by
BMP2 or osteogenic induction medium. Depletion of CHD7 in MSC via siRNA knockdown
resulted in inhibition of key osteogenic transcription factors and impaired
osteogenic capability of MSC. Complementarily, overexpression of CHD7 in MSC led 
to increased osteogenic ability. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CHD7
interacted with SMAD1, downstream factor of BMP signaling. BMP2 stimulated the
binding of CHD7 to the enhancer region of SP7. Finally, CHD7-silencing MSC showed
comprised osteogenic ability when cultured with scaffold in vivo. Overall, our
study established a new epigenetic regulation of MSC osteogenic differentiation
and provided a potential target for controlling MSC osteogenesis.

Several basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors have recently been
identified to regulate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. In the
present study, Tcf12 was investigated for its involvement in the osteoblastic
cell commitment of MSCs. Tcf12 was found highly expressed in undifferentiated
MSCs whereas its expression decreased following osteogenic culture
differentiation. Interestingly, Tcf12 endogenous silencing using shRNA lentivirus
significantly promoted the differentiation ability of MSCs evaluated by alkaline 
phosphatase staining, alizarin red staining and expression of osteoblast-specific
markers by real-time PCR. Conversely, overexpression of Tcf12 in MSCs suppressed 
osteoblast differentiation. It was further found that silencing of Tcf12
activated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 signaling pathway activity and upregulated the
expression of phospho-SMAD1 and phospho-Erk1/2. A BMP inhibitor (LDN-193189) and 
Erk1/2 signaling pathway inhibitor (U0126) reduced these findings in the Tcf12
silencing group. Following these in vitro results, a poly-L-lactic
acid/Hydroxyappatite scaffold carrying Tcf12 silencing lentivirus was utilized to
investigate the repair of bone defects in vivo. The use of Tcf12 silencing
lentivirus significantly promoted new bone formation in 3-mm mouse calvarial
defects as assessed by micro-CT and histological examination whereas
overexpression of Tcf12 inhibited new bone formation. Collectively, these data
indicate that Tcf12 is a transcription factor highly expressed in the nuclei of
stem cells and its downregulation plays an essential role in osteoblast
differentiation partially via BMP and Erk1/2 signaling pathways. Stem Cells

BACKGROUND: The Activin A and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways are
critical regulators of the immune system and of bone formation. Inappropriate
activation of these pathways, as in conditions of congenital heterotopic
ossification, are thought to activate an osteogenic program in endothelial cells.
However, if and how this occurs in human endothelial cells remains unclear.
METHODS: We used a new directed differentiation protocol to create human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived endothelial cells (iECs) from patients with
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a congenital disease of heterotopic 
ossification caused by an activating R206H mutation in the Activin A type I
receptor (ACVR1). This strategy allowed the direct assay of the cell-autonomous
effects of ACVR1 R206H in the endogenous locus without the use of transgenic
expression. These cells were challenged with BMP or Activin A ligand, and tested 
for their ability to activate osteogenesis, extracellular matrix production, and 
differential downstream signaling in the BMP/Activin A pathways.
RESULTS: We found that FOP iECs could form in conditions with low or absent BMP4.
These conditions are not normally permissive in control cells. FOP iECs cultured 
in mineralization media showed increased alkaline phosphatase staining,
suggesting formation of immature osteoblasts, but failed to show mature
osteoblastic features. However, FOP iECs expressed more fibroblastic genes and
Collagen 1/2 compared to control iECs, suggesting a mechanism for the tissue
fibrosis seen in early heterotopic lesions. Finally, FOP iECs showed increased
SMAD1/5/8 signaling upon BMP4 stimulation. Contrary to FOP hiPSCs, FOP iECs did
not show a significant increase in SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation upon Activin A
stimulation, suggesting that the ACVR1 R206H mutation has a cell type-specific
effect. In addition, we found that the expression of ACVR1 and type II receptors 
were different in hiPSCs and iECs, which could explain the cell type-specific
SMAD signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ACVR1 R206H mutation may not directly
increase the formation of mature chondrogenic or osteogenic cells by FOP iECs.
Our results also show that BMP can induce endothelial cell dysfunction, increase 
expression of fibrogenic matrix proteins, and cause differential downstream
signaling of the ACVR1 R206H mutation. This iPSC model provides new insight into 
how human endothelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of heterotopic
ossification.

SCOPE: Yuja (Citrus junos Tanaka) possesses various health benefits, but its
effects on bone health are unknown. In this study, the preventative effects of
yuja peel ethanol extract (YPEE) on osteopenia were determined in ovariectomized 
(OVX) rats, and the mechanisms by which YPEE and its flavanones regulate
osteoblastogenesis were examined in vitro.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of YPEE on osteoblastogenesis were investigated 
in MC3T3-E1 cells. YPEE promoted alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity,
mineralization, and the expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes,
such as ALP, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin. YPEE
and its flavanones promoted osteoblast differentiation via BMP-2-mediated p38 and
the Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. YPEE supplementation significantly decreased
body weight and increased uterine weight and bone mineral density in OVX rats.
Based on a micro-CT analysis of femurs, YPEE significantly attenuated osteopenia 
and increased trabecular volume fraction, trabecular separation, and trabecular
number (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Dietary YPEE has a protective effect on OVX-induced osteopenia. YPEE 
and its flavanones promote osteoblastogenesis via the activation of the
BMP/p38/Smad/Runx2 pathways. These results extend our knowledge of the beneficial
effects of YPEE and provide a basis for the development of novel therapies for
osteoporosis.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare and devastating genetic
disease of heterotopic endochondral ossification (HEO), and currently no
effective therapies are available for this disease. A recurrent causative
heterozygous mutation (c.617 G>A; R206H) for FOP was identified in activin
receptor type IA (ACVR1), a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor.
This mutation aberrantly activates the BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway and leads 
to HEO in FOP patients. Here we report development of a soluble recombinant
ACVR1-Fc fusion protein by combining the extracellular domain of human wild type 
ACVR1 and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1). The ACVR1-Fc
fusion protein significantly down-regulated the dysregulated BMP signaling caused
by the FOP ACVR1 mutation and effectively suppressed chondro-osseous
differentiation in a previously described cellular FOP model, human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were infected with adenovirus-ACVR1R206H
(HUVECR206H). This ACVR1-Fc fusion protein holds great promise for prevention and
treatment of HEO in FOP and related diseases.

Microenvironmental conditions can interfere with the functional role and
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Recent studies suggest that an 
inflammatory microenvironment can significantly impact the osteogenic potential
of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), but the precise effects and
mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we show for the first time that
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has dual roles in the osteogenesis of PDLSCs at
concentrations ranging from physiologically healthy levels to those found in
chronic periodontitis. Low doses of IL-1β activate the BMP/Smad signaling pathway
to promote the osteogenesis of PDLSCs, but higher doses of IL-1β inhibit BMP/Smad
signaling through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, inhibiting osteogenesis. These
results demonstrate that crosstalk between NF-κB, MAPK and BMP/Smad signaling
mediates this dual effect of IL-1β on PDLSCs. We also show that the impaired
osteogenesis of PDLSCs results in more inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
being released, inducing the chemotaxis of macrophages, which further clarifies
the role of PDLSCs in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

BACKGROUND: Medial artery calcification develops in diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and as part of the aging process. It is associated with increased
morbidity and mortality in vascular patients. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 
have previously been implicated in the initiation and progression of vascular
calcification. We thus evaluated whether dorsomorphin homologue 1 (DMH1), a
highly selective BMP inhibitor, could attenuate vascular calcification in vitro
and in an organ culture model of medial calcification.
METHODS: Confluent human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were cultured in
calcification medium containing 3.0 mM inorganic phosphate (Pi) for 7 days with
or without DMH1. Medial calcification was assessed using an aortic organ culture 
model. Calcification was visualized by alizarin red S staining, and calcium
concentration was assessed by an o-cresolphthalein complexone calcium assay.
Osteogenic cell and vascular SMC markers were determined by Western blot,
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and
immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: DMH1 reduced Pi-induced calcium deposition in human SMCs. It also
antagonized human recombinant BMP2-induced calcium accumulation. Western blot
further revealed that DMH1 was able to block Pi-mediated upregulation of the
osteoblast markers osterix and alkaline phosphatase and downregulation of the SMC
markers smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and SM22α as well as p-Smad1/5/8,
suggesting that DMH1 may regulate SMC osteogenic differentiation through the
BMP/Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway. Finally, using an ex vivo aortic ring organ
culture model, we observed that DMH1 reduces Pi-induced aortic medial
calcification.
CONCLUSIONS: The selective BMP inhibitor DMH1 can inhibit calcium accumulation in
vascular SMCs and arterial segments exposed to elevated phosphate levels. Such
small molecules may have clinical utility in reducing medial artery calcification
in our population of vascular patients.

The molecular mechanisms controlling the differentiation of bone marrow stromal
stem cells into osteoblasts remain largely unknown. In this study, we
investigated whether bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) influences
differentiation toward the osteoblasts lineage. BST2 mRNA expression in human
alveolar-derived bone marrow stromal cells (hAD-BMSCs) increased during
differentiation into osteoblasts. hAD-BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts and 
the mRNA expression of the bone-specific markers alkaline phosphatase, collagen
type α 1, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and osterix were reduced by BST2
knockdown using siRNA. Furthermore, BST2 knockdown in hAD-BMSCs resulted in
decreased RUNX2 mRNA and protein expression. We hypothesized that BST2 is
involved in differentiation of into osteoblasts via the BMP2 signaling pathway.
Accordingly, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of BMP2, BMP receptors
(BMPR1 and 2), and the downstream signaling molecules SMAD1, SMAD4, and
p-SMAD1/5/8 in BST2 knockdown cells. BMP2 expression following the induction of
differentiation was significantly lower in BST2 knockdown cells than in cells
treated with a non-targeting control siRNA. Similar results were found for the
knockdown of the BMP2 receptor- BMPR1A. We also identified significantly lower
expression of SMAD1, SMAD4, and p-SMAD1/5/8 in the BST2 knockdown cells than
control cells. Our data provide the first evidence that BST2 is involved in the
osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells via the regulation of the
BMP2 signaling pathway.

The nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs) play key roles in skeletal development
and endochondral ossification. Previously, we showed that RARγ regulates
chondrogenesis and that pharmacological activation of RARγ blocked heterotopic
ossification (HO), pathology in which endochondral bone forms in soft tissues.
Thus, we reasoned that pharmacological inhibition of RARγ should enhance
endochondral ossification, leading to a potential therapeutic strategy for bone
deficiencies. We created surgical bone defects in wild type and RARγ-null mice
and monitored bone healing. Fibrous, cartilaginous, and osseous tissues formed in
both groups by day 7, but more cartilaginous tissue formed in mutants within and 
around the defects compared to controls. Next, we implanted a mixture of Matrigel
and rhBMP2 subdermally to induce ectopic endochondral ossification.
Administration of RARγ antagonists significantly stimulated ectopic bone
formation in wild type but not in RARγ-null mice. The antagonist-induced
increases in bone formation were preceded by increases in cartilage formation and
were accompanied by higher levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8)
compared to vehicle-treated control. Higher pSmad1/5/8 levels were also observed 
in cartilaginous tissues forming in healing bone defects in RARγ-null mice, and
increases in pSmad1/5/8 levels and Id1-luc activity were observed in RARγ
antagonist-treated chondrogenic cells in culture. Our data show that genetic or
pharmacological interference with RARγ stimulates endochondral bone formation and
does so at least in part by stimulating canonical BMP signaling. This
pharmacologic strategy could represent a new tool to enhance endochondral bone
formation in the setting of various orthopedic surgical interventions and other
skeletal deficiencies. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating hip disorder, which
often produces a permanent femoral head deformity and osteoarthritis. The local
delivery of biological agents capable of stimulating bone healing offer potential
new treatment options for patients with ONFH. Previous studies from our
laboratory have shown that a local intraosseous infusion of bone morphogenic
protein-2 (BMP-2) was effective in stimulating new bone formation in a piglet
model of ischemic ONFH. However, infusion of BMP-2 solution was associated with
unwanted dissemination of BMP-2 out of the femoral head and produced heterotopic 
ossification in the hip capsule. Injectable hydrogels offer a potential method to
control the dissemination of biological molecules in vivo. In the present study, 
we evaluated the potential of a peptide-based, self-assembling hydrogel called
RADA16 to transition from a solution to a gel following infusion into the femoral
head, thereby preventing backflow, as well as its potential use as a delivery
vehicle for BMP-2. Cadaver pig femoral heads were used to study the backflow and 
the distribution of RADA16 following an intraosseous infusion. Microcomputed
tomography analysis following the infusion of RADA16 mixed with a radiocontrast
agent revealed a significant decrease in the amount of back flow of radiocontrast
agent down the needle track compared to the soluble infusion of radiocontrast
without RADA16. Furthermore, RADA16 mixed with radiocontrast agent showed good
distribution within the femoral head. In addition, in vitro experiments revealed 
that higher concentrations of RADA16 decreased the rate of BMP-2 dissemination
out of the hydrogel. The BMP-2 that was released from RADA16 maintains its
biological activity, inducing the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in pig primary
bone marrow stromal cells. Lastly, pig primary bone marrow stromal cells showed
significantly increased in vitro proliferation on RADA16 hydrogels over 1 week
compared to tissue culture plastic, suggesting that it is a suitable matrix for
supporting cellular proliferation. In conclusion, RADA16 showed potential for use
as a drug delivery vehicle to control the delivery of BMP-2 within the femoral
head. This novel therapy may be able to provide benefits to patients suffering
from debilitating conditions such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Pin1 is an enzyme that specifically recognizes the peptide bond between
phosphorylated serine or threonine (pS/pT-P) and proline. This recognition causes
a conformational change of its substrate, which further regulates downstream
signaling. Pin1-/- mice show developmental bone defects and reduced
mineralization. Pin1 targets RUNX2 (Runt-Related Transcription Factor 2),
SMAD1/5, and β-catenin in the FGF, BMP, and WNT pathways, respectively. Pin1 has 
multiple roles in the crosstalk between different anabolic bone signaling
pathways. For example, it controls different aspects of osteoblastogenesis and
increases the transcriptional activity of Runx2, both directly and indirectly.
Pin1 also influences osteoclastogenesis at different stages by targeting PU.1
(Purine-rich nucleic acid binding protein 1), C-FOS, and DC-STAMP. The phenotype 
of Pin1-/- mice has led to the recent identification of multiple roles of Pin1 in
different molecular pathways in bone cells. These roles suggest that Pin1 can be 
utilized as an efficient drug target in congenital and acquired bone diseases. J.

OBJECTIVE: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent type of
heart valve disease, affecting ≈2% of the US population. CAVD is characterized by
the presence of calcific nodules, resulting in aortic valve (AoV) stenosis;
however, the underlying mechanisms driving disease remain unknown. Studies of
human diseased AoV provide initial evidence that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling, essential for normal bone formation, is activated during CAVD. Mice
deficient in Klotho, an FGF23 transmembrane coreceptor, exhibit premature aging
and develop AoV calcific nodules as occurs in human CAVD. The role of BMP
signaling in the development of CAVD was examined in porcine aortic valve
interstitial cells (VICs) and Klotho(-/-) mice.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We show that activation of BMP signaling, as indicated by
pSmad1/5/8 expression, precedes and later localizes with AoV calcification in
Klotho(-/-) mice. In addition, cellular and extracellular matrix changes
resembling features of normal bone formation are accompanied by increased
osteochondrogenic gene induction in calcified Klotho(-/-) AoV. Likewise,
osteogenic media treatment of porcine VICs results in BMP pathway activation,
increased osteochondrogenic gene induction, and formation of calcific nodules in 
vitro. We demonstrate that genetic inactivation of the BMP type IA receptor in
Klotho(-/-) aortic VICs, as well as BMP pathway inhibition of osteogenic
media-treated aortic VICs in vitro, results in the inhibition of AoV
calcification.
CONCLUSIONS: BMP signaling and osteochondrogenic gene induction are active in
calcified Klotho(-/-) AoV in vivo and calcified porcine aortic VICs in vitro.
Importantly, BMP signaling is required for the development of AoV calcification
in vitro and in vivo.

As human lifespans have increased, the incidence of osteoporosis has also
increased. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) affects the process of mesenchymal stem
cell (MSC) differentiation into osteoblasts via the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5b signaling pathway, and bone
morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP‑2) is also known to significantly affect bone
health. In addition, the phosphorylation of small mothers against decapentaplegic
(Smad)1/5/8 regulates the Runt‑related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) gene, which
encodes a transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation markers. In the
present study, the differentiation of MSCs treated with MSM, BMP‑2, and their
combination were examined. The differentiation of osteoblasts was demonstrated
through observation of morphological changes and mineralization, using alizarin
red and Von Kossa staining. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the
combination of MSM and BMP-2 increased the phosphorylation of the BMP
signaling-associated protein, Smad1/5/8. Combination of MSM and BMP-2
significantly increased osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the MSCs
compared with either MSM or BMP-2 alone. Additionally, reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that combination of
MSM and BMP-2 increased the expression level of the Runx2 gene and the osteoblast
differentiation marker genes, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein and
osteocalcin, in MSCs compared with controls. Thus, the combination of MSM and
BMP-2 may promote the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts.

Orai1 is a pore-subunit of store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) 
channel that mediates Ca(2+) influx in most non-excitable cells via
store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) mechanism. We previously demonstrated that
Orai1 is involved in mediating osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs), but the underlying mechanism of this function remains unknown. Here, we
report that Orai1 mediates osteogenic differentiation via bone morphogenic
protein (BMP) signaling pathway in bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs). In osteogenic
conditions, BMSCs derived from wild-type mice underwent osteoblastic
differentiation and induced mineralization as demonstrated by increased alkaline 
phosphatase activity and alizarin red S staining, respectively. The expression of
Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, and osteogenic
differentiation markers were markedly increased in wild-type BMSCs under
osteogenic conditions. In contrast, osteogenic conditions failed to induce such
effects in BMSCs derived from Orai1-deficient (Orai1(-/-)) mice, indicating that 
Orai1 is, in part, necessary for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. We also
found that BMP2 successfully induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, the immediate 
effector molecules of BMP signaling, in wild-type BMSCs, but failed to do so in
Orai1(-/-) BMSCs. Downstream target genes of BMP signaling pathway were
consistently increased by osteogenic conditions in wild-type BMSCs, but not in
Orai1(-/-) BMSCs, suggesting a novel molecular link between Orai1 and BMP
signaling pathway in the osteogenic differentiation process. Further functional
studies demonstrated that activation of BMP signaling rescues osteogenic
differentiation capacity of Orai1(-/-) BMSCs. In conclusion, Orai1 regulates
osteogenic differentiation through BMP signaling, and the Orai1-BMP signaling may
be a possible therapeutic target for treating bone-related diseases.

Dovitinib (TKI258) is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor currently in
clinical phase I/II/III development for the treatment of various types of
cancers. This drug has a safe and effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
profile. Although dovitinib can bind several kinases at nanomolar concentrations,
there are no reports relating to osteoporosis or osteoblast differentiation.
Herein, we investigated the effect of dovitinib on human recombinant bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2-induced osteoblast differentiation in a cell
culture model. Dovitinib enhanced the BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
induction, which is a representative marker of osteoblast differentiation.
Dovitinib also stimulated the translocation of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 into the 
nucleus and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including
ERK1/2 and p38. In addition, the mRNA expression of BMP-4, BMP-7, ALP, and OCN
increased with dovitinib treatment. Our results suggest that dovitinib has a
potent stimulating effect on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation and this
existing drug has potential for repositioning in the treatment of bone-related
disorders.

Linarin (LIN), a flavonoid which exerts both anti-inflammatory and antioxidative 
effects, has been found to promote osteogenic differentiation. However, the
molecular mechanism of its effect on osteoblast differentiation was unclear. In
the present study, LIN from Flos Chrysanthemi Indici (FCI) was isolated in order 
to investigate the underlying mechanisms of LIN on MC3T3-E1 cells (a mouse
osteoblastic cell line) and the osteoprotective effect of LIN in mice which had
undergone an ovariectomy (OVX). The results revealed that LIN enhanced osteoblast
proliferation and differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells dose‑dependently, with
enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization of extracellular 
matrix. LIN upregulated osteogenesis-related gene expression, including that of
ALP, runt‑related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osteocalcin (OCN), bone
sialoprotein (BSP), and type I collagen (COL‑I). Pretreatment with noggin, a bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) antagonist, meant that LIN-induced gene
expression levels of COL-1, ALP, OCN, BSP and RUNX2 were significantly reduced,
as shown by RT-qPCR. Western blot analysis showed that LIN dose‑dependently
increased the protein levels of BMP-2 and RUNX2 and enhanced the phosphorylation 
of SMAD1/5. In addition, LIN dose‑dependently upregulated protein kinase A (PKA) 
expression. H-89 (a PKA inhibitor) partially blocked the LIN-induced protein
increase in BMP-2, p-SMAD1/5 and RUNX2. We noted that LIN preserved the
trabecular bone microarchitecture of ovariectomized mice in vivo. Moreover,
pretreatment with LIN significantly lowered serum levels of ALP and OCN in
ovariectomized mice. Our data indicated that LIN induced the osteogenic
differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells by activating
the BMP-2/RUNX2 pathway through PKA signaling in vitro and protected against
OVX-induced bone loss in vivo. The results strongly suggest that LIN is a useful 
natural alternative for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Deficiency of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) has been associated
with severe craniofacial anomalies in both humans and mice. Cranial neural crest 
cell (NCC)-derived VEGF regulates proliferation, vascularization and ossification
of cartilage and membranous bone. However, the function of VEGF derived from
specific subpopulations of NCCs in controlling unique aspects of craniofacial
morphogenesis is not clear. In this study a conditional knockdown strategy was
used to genetically delete Vegfa expression in Osterix (Osx) and collagen II
(Col2)-expressing NCC descendants. No major defects in calvaria and mandibular
morphogenesis were observed upon knockdown of VEGF in the Col2(+) cell
population. In contrast, loss of VEGF in Osx(+) osteoblast progenitor cells led
to reduced ossification of calvarial and mandibular bones without affecting the
formation of cartilage templates in newborn mice. The early stages of
ossification in the developing jaw revealed decreased initial mineralization
levels and a reduced thickness of the collagen I (Col1)-positive bone template
upon loss of VEGF in Osx(+) precursors. Increased numbers of proliferating cells 
were detected within the jaw mesenchyme of mutant embryos. Explant culture assays
revealed that mandibular osteogenesis occurred independently of paracrine VEGF
action and vascular development. Reduced VEGF expression in mandibles coincided
with increased phospho-Smad1/5 (P-Smad1/5) levels and bone morphogenetic protein 
2 (Bmp2) expression in the jaw mesenchyme. We conclude that VEGF derived from
Osx(+) osteoblast progenitor cells is required for optimal ossification of
developing mandibular bones and modulates mechanisms controlling BMP-dependent
specification and expansion of the jaw mesenchyme.

of SMAD1 Activity in Osteoblasts.

Bone formation and homeostasis is carried out by osteoblasts, whose
differentiation and activity are regulated by osteogenic signaling networks. A
central mediator of these inputs is the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K). However, at present, there are no data on the specific role of
distinct class IA PI3K isoforms in bone biology. Here, we performed
osteoblast-specific deletion in mice to show that both p110α and p110β isoforms
are required for survival and differentiation and function of osteoblasts and
thereby control bone formation and postnatal homeostasis. Impaired osteogenesis
arises from increased GSK3 activity and a depletion of SMAD1 protein levels in
PI3K-deficient osteoblasts. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of GSK3
activity or ectopic expression of SMAD1 or SMAD5 normalizes bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) transduction and osteoblast differentiation. Together, these
results identify the PI3K-GSK3-SMAD1 axis as a central node integrating multiple 
signaling networks that govern bone formation and homeostasis. © 2016 American

To accomplish effective periodontal regeneration for periodontal defects, several
regenerative methods using growth and differentiation factors, including bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), have been developed. Bone morphogenetic protein-9 
exhibits the most potent osteogenic activity of this growth factor family.
However, it is unclear whether exogenous BMP-9 can induce osteogenic
differentiation in human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts. Here, we
examined the effects of recombinant human (rh) BMP-9 on osteoblastic
differentiation in human PDL fibroblasts in vitro, compared with rhBMP-2.
Recombinant human BMP-9 potently induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity,
mineralization, and increased expression of runt-related transcription
factor-2/core binding factor alpha 1 (RUNX2/CBFA1), osterix, inhibitor of DNA
binding/differentiation-1 (ID1), osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein genes,
compared with rhBMP-2. The levels of rhBMP-9-induced osterix and ALP mRNA were
significantly reduced in activin receptor-like kinase-1 and -2 small interfering 
RNA (siRNA)-transfected human PDL fibroblasts. Recombinant human BMP-9-induced
ALP activity was not inhibited by noggin, in contrast to rhBMP-2 induced ALP
activity, which was. Phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 in human PDL fibroblasts was
induced by addition of rhBMP-9. Recombinant human BMP-9-induced ALP activity was 
suppressed by SB203580, SP600125, and U0126, which are inhibitors of p38, c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), 
respectively. Our data suggest that rhBMP-9 is a potent inducer of the
differentiation of human PDL fibroblasts into osteoblast-like cells and that this
may be mediated by the SMAD and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38, ERK1/2,
and JNK) pathways.

Bioactive borate glass (BG) has emerged as a promising alternative for bone
regeneration due to its high osteoinductivity, osteoconductivity, compressive
strength, and biocompatibility. However, the role of BG in large segmental bone
repair is unclear and little is known about the underlying mechanism of BG's
osteoinductivity. In this study, we demonstrated that BG possessed pro-osteogenic
effects in an experimental model of critical-sized radius defects. Transplanting 
BG to radius defects resulted in better repair of bone defects as compared to
widely used β-TCP. Histological and morphological analysis indicated that BG
significantly enhanced new bone formation. Furthermore, the degradation rate of
the BG was faster than that of β-TCP, which matched the higher bone regeneration 
rate. In addition, ions from BG enhanced cell viability, ALP activity, and
osteogenic-related genes expression. Mechanistically, the critical genes Smad1/5 
and Dlx5 in the BMP pathway and p-Smad1/5 proteins were significantly elevated
after BG transplantation, and these effects could be blocked by the BMP/Smad
specific inhibitor. Taken together, our findings suggest that BG could repair
large segmental bone defects through activating the BMP/Smad pathway and
osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs.

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a growth factor used to stimulate bone
regeneration in clinical applications. However, there are contradicting reports
on the functionality of BMP-2 in human adipose stem cells (hASCs), which are
frequently used in tissue engineering. In this study, we analyzed the effects of 
BMP-2 on SMAD1/5 signaling, proliferation, and differentiation in hASCs. Our
results indicated that BMP-2 induced dose-dependent (25-100 ng/ml) activation of 
SMAD signaling. Furthermore, the cell proliferation analysis revealed that BMP-2 
(100 ng/ml) consistently decreased the proliferation in all the cell lines
studied. However, the analysis of the differentiation potential revealed that
BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) exhibited a donor-dependent dual role, inducing both osteogenic
and adipogenic differentiation in hASCs. The quantitative alkaline phosphatase
(qALP) activity and mineralization levels were clearly enhanced in particular
donor cell lines by BMP-2 stimulus. On the contrary, in other cell lines, qALP
and mineralization levels were diminished and the lipid formation was enhanced.
The current study also suggests that hASCs have accelerated biochemical
responsiveness to BMP-2 stimulus in human serum-supplemented culture medium
compared with fetal bovine serum. The production origin of the BMP-2 growth
factor is also important for its response: BMP-2 produced in mammalian cells
enhanced signaling and differentiation responses compared with BMP-2 produced in 
Escherichia coli. These results explain the existing contradiction in the
reported BMP-2 studies and indicate the variability in the functional end
mechanism of BMP-2-stimulated hASCs.SIGNIFICANCE: This study examined how bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) modulates the SMAD signaling mechanism and the
proliferation and differentiation outcome of human adipose stem cells (hASCs)
derived from several donors. The results indicate that BMP-2 triggers molecular
SMAD signaling mechanisms in hASCs and regulates differentiation processes in
human serum-culture conditions. Importantly, BMP-2 has dual activity, inducing
osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, subject to hASC donor line studied.
These findings explain contradictory previous results and highlight the
importance of further studies to understand how signaling pathways guide
mesenchymal stem cell functions at the molecular level.

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is known to be involved in a variety of cellular
processes, such as DNA repair, cell death, telomere regulation, genomic stability
and cell differentiation by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). While PARP
inhibitors are presently under clinical investigation for cancer therapy, little 
is known about their side effects. However, PARP involvement in mesenchymal stem 
cell (MSC) differentiation potentiates MSC-related side effects arising from PARP
inhibition. In this study, effects of PARP inhibitors on MSCs were examined. MSCs
demonstrated suppressed osteogenic differentiation after 1 µM PJ34 treatment
without cytotoxicity, while differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes or
adipocytes was unaffected. PJ34 suppressed mRNA induction of osteogenic markers, 
such as Runx2, Osterix, Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2, Osteocalcin, bone
sialoprotein, and Osteopontin, and protein levels of Bone Morphogenetic
Protein-2, Osterix and Osteocalcin. PJ34 treatment also inhibited transcription
factor regulators such as Smad1, Smad4, Smad5 and Smad8. Extracellular
mineralized matrix formation was also diminished. These results strongly suggest 
that PARP inhibitors are capable of suppressing osteogenic differentiation and
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may play a physiological role in this process through
regulation of BMP-2 signaling. Therefore, PARP inhibition may potentially
attenuate osteogenic metabolism, implicating cautious use of PARP inhibitors for 
cancer treatments and monitoring of patient bone metabolism levels.

Differentiation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has been demonstrated to have a close
relationship with inflammation in the body. Although most researchers confirmed
that TNF-α can have an effect on the expression of osteoblast specific genes,
they had not elucidated the regulation of inflammatory factors in osteogenic gene
expression during the process of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs)
differentiating to osteoblast. The aim of this study was to investigate the
effect of TNF-α at different concentrations on osteogenetic differentiation of
BMMSCs. In this study, BMMSCs proliferation was analyzed by using cell counting
kit-8 assay, cell osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by means of alkaline
phosphatase activity assay and Von Koaas staining and the messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression of bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2) and drosophila mothers
against decapentaplegic protein 1 (Smad1) was measured through real-time
polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that a low concentration of
TNF-α at short-term promotes the osteogenetic differentiation of BMMSCs and
increases the mRNA expression of BMP-2 and Smad1, but inhibits the osteogenetic
differentiation of BMMSCs and the expression of BMP-2 and Smad1 at long term. In 
addition, regardless of a short or long time, a high concentration of TNF-α
inhibits the osteogenetic differentiation of BMMSCs and the expression of Smad1, 
but results in a high expression of BMP-2.

OBJECTIVE: To study the osteogenic differentiation capacity of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from patients with ankylosing
spondylitis (AS) and to investigate the mechanisms of abnormal osteogenic
differentiation of BM-MSCs in AS.
METHODS: BM-MSCs from healthy donors (HD-MSCs) and patients with AS (AS-MSCs)
were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium for 0-21 days, after which
their osteogenic differentiation capacity was determined using alizarin red S and
alkaline phosphatase assays. Gene expression levels of osteoblastic markers and
related cytokines were detected by high-throughput quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
performed to detect protein levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and
Noggin in the cell culture supernatant. The activation of Smad1/5/8 and MAPK
signaling pathways was measured by Western blotting. The balance between BMP-2
and Noggin expression was regulated using lentiviruses encoding short hairpin RNA
and exogenous Noggin, respectively, which enabled evaluation of how this balance 
affected osteogenic differentiation of AS-MSCs.
RESULTS: AS-MSCs outperformed HD-MSCs in osteogenic differentiation capacity.
During osteogenic differentiation, AS-MSCs secreted more BMP-2 but less Noggin,
accompanied by an overactivation of Smad1/5/8 and ERK-1/2. When the Noggin
concentration was increased or BMP-2 expression was inhibited, the abnormal
osteogenic differentiation of AS-MSCs was rectified. In addition, the balance
between BMP-2 and Noggin secretion was restored.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that an imbalance between BMP-2
and Noggin secretion induces abnormal osteogenic differentiation of AS-MSCs.
These findings reveal a mechanism of pathologic osteogenesis in AS and provide a 
new perspective on inhibiting pathologic osteogenesis by regulating the balance
between BMP-2 and Noggin.

BMP induces osteoblast differentiation, whereas a key proinflammatory cytokine,
TNF-α, causes inflammatory bone damage shown in rheumatoid arthritis. FGF
molecules are known to be involved in bone homeostasis. However, the effects of
FGF-8 on osteoblast differentiation and the interaction between FGF-8, BMPs and
TNF-α have yet to be clarified. Here we investigated the effects of FGF-8 in
relation to TNF-α actions on BMP-2-induced osteoblast marker expression using
myoblast cell line C2C12, osteoblast precursor cell line MC3T3-E1 and rat
calvarial osteoblasts. It was revealed that FGF-8 inhibited BMP-2-induced
expression of osteoblast differentiation markers, including Runx2, osteocalcin,
alkaline phosphatase, type-1 collagen and osterix, in a concentration-dependent
manner. The inhibitory effects of FGF-8 on BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation
and Smad1/5/8 activation were enhanced in the presence of TNF-α action. FGF-8
also inhibited BMP-2-induced expression of Wnt5a, which activates a non-canonical
Wnt signaling pathway. FGF-8 had no significant influence on the expression
levels of TNF receptors, while FGF-8 suppressed the expression of inhibitory
Smad6 and Smad7, suggesting a possible feedback activity through FGF to BMP
receptor (BMPR) signaling. Of note, inhibition of ERK activity and FGF receptor
(FGFR)-dependent protein kinase, but not JNK or NFκB pathway, suppressed the
FGF-8 actions on BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. FGF-8 was revealed to
suppress BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation through the ERK pathway and the
effects were enhanced by TNF-α. Given the finding that FGF-8 expression was
increased in synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis, the functional interaction
between FGFR and BMPR signaling may be involved in the development process of
inflammatory bone damage.

Recently we have demonstrated the importance of RBPjk-dependent Notch signaling
in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation during
skeletogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Here we further performed RBPJK
loss-of-function experiments to demonstrate for the first time that RBPJK
deficient MSC shows enhanced differentiation and osteogenesis acts via
up-regulation of the BMP signaling. In the present study, we first compared the
spontaneous and osteogenic differentiation in normal and recombination signal
binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJK) deficient human bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It was found that RBPJK highly
expressed in fresh isolated MSCs and its expression was progressing
down-regulated during spontaneous differentiation and even greater in osteogenic 
media inducted differentiation. Deletion of RBPJK in MSCs not only enhances cell 
spontaneous differentiation, but also significantly accelerates condition media
inducted osteogenic differentiation by showing enhanced alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) activity, Alizarin red staining, gene expression of Runx2, Osteopontin
(OPN), Type I collagen (COL1a1) in culture. Additionally, BMP signaling
responsive reporter activity and phosphor-smad1/5/8 expression were also
significantly increased upon removal of RBPJK in MSCs. These data proved that
inhibition of Notch signaling in MSCs promotes cell osteogenic differentiation by
up-regulation of BMP signaling, and RBPJK deficient MSC maybe a better cell
population for cell-based bone tissue engineering.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) emerge as important regulators of stem cell lineage commitment
and bone development. MiRNA-26a (miR-26a) is one of the important miRNAs
regulating osteogenic differentiation of both bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (BMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs).
However, miR-26a functions oppositely in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and 
ADSCs, suggesting distinct post-transcriptional regulation of tissue-specific MSC
differentiation. However, the molecular basis is largely unknown. Here, we report
that the function of miR-26a is largely depended on the intrinsic signaling
regulation network of MSCs. Using bioinformatics and functional assay, we
confirmed that miR-26a potentially targeted on GSK3β and Smad1 to regulate Wnt
and BMP signaling pathway. Overall comparative analysis revealed that Wnt
signaling was enhanced more potently and played a more important role than BMP
signaling in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, whereas BMP pathway was more
essential for promoting osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. The distinct
activation pattern and role of signaling pathways determined that miR-26a majorly
targeted on GSK3β to activate Wnt signaling for promoting osteogenic
differentiation of BMSCs, whereas it inhibited Smad1 to suppress BMP signaling
for interfering with the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Taken together, our
study demonstrated that BMSCs and ADSCs applied different signaling pathway to
facilitate their osteogenic differentiation, which determined the inverse
function of miR-26a. The distinct transcriptional regulation and
post-transcriptional regulation network suggested the intrinsic molecular
differences between tissue-specific MSCs and the complexity in MSC research and
MSC-based cell therapy.

Preserving bioactivity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) still remains a
challenge in protein-based therapy. It is not known how Ca(2+) released from
extracellular matrix or existing in physiological environment influences
bioactivity in situ till now. Here, effects of extracellular Ca(2+) on
conformation and osteogenic bioactivity of recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) were
investigated systematically. In vitro results indicated that Ca(2+) could bind
rhBMP-2 rapidly and had no obvious effect on cell behaviors. Low concentration of
Ca(2+) (0.18 mM) enhanced rhBMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation, while high 
Ca(2+) concentration (>1.80 mM) exerted negative effect. In vivo ectopic bone
formation exhibited similar trend. Further studies by circular dichroism
spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, together with cell culture experiments
revealed at low concentration, weak interaction of Ca(2+) and rhBMP(-)2 slightly 
increased β-sheet/-turn content and facilitated recognition of BMP-2 and BMPRIA. 
But, high Ca(2+) concentration (>1.8 mM) induced formation of Ca-rhBMP-2 complex 
and markedly increased content of β-sheet/-turn, which led to inhibition binding 
of rhBMP-2 and BMPRIA and thus suppression of downstream Smad1/5/8, ERK1/2 and
p38 mitogen-associated protein kinase signaling pathways. Our work suggests
osteogenic bioactivity of BMP-2 can be adjusted via extracellular Ca(2+), which
should provide guide and assist for development of BMP-2-based materials for bone
regeneration.

OBJECTIVE: BMP-2 induces osteoblast differentiation and activates osteoclast
formation. Here, we investigated the role of Smad1, a molecule that signals
downstream of BMP-2, in mediating the effects of BMP-2 on osteoclast
differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) in osteoblasts.
DESIGN: The effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and BMP-2 in osteoclasts were examined using
polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to measure changes in target gene 
and protein expression. Immunostaining was carried out to investigate the
localization of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the nucleus in response to BMP-2.
RESULTS: Stimulation with both 1,25(OH)2D3 and BMP-2 resulted in significantly
greater osteoclast formation and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand
(RANKL) mRNA expression compared to stimulation with 1,25(OH)2D3 alone. In
addition, expression of the VDR protein was increased, enhancing the activity of 
1,25(OH)2D3. Interestingly, knockdown of Smad1 resulted in reduced osteoclast
formation, RANKL mRNA expression, and VDR protein expression compared with
control cells. Costimulation with 1,25(OH)2D3 and BMP-2 enhanced VDR localization
in the nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that BMP-2 induced Smad1 activation, thereby influencing
the localization of VDR in the nucleus in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 and
resulting in increased RANKL mRNA expression. These effects ultimately resulted
in enhanced osteoclast differentiation.

Phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) was first
isolated as an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding protein. We generated PRIP
gene-deficient mice which exhibited the increased bone mineral density and
trabecular bone volume, indicating that PRIP is implicated in the regulation of
bone properties. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms by which 
PRIP plays a role in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, by analyzing the
culture of primary cells isolated from calvaria of two genotypes, the wild type
and a mutant. In the mutant culture, enhanced osteoblast differentiation was
observed by measuring alkaline phosphatase staining and activity. The promoter
activity of Id1 gene, responding immediately to BMP, was also more increased.
Smad1/5 phosphorylation in response to BMP showed an enhanced peak and was more
persistent in mutant cells, but the dephosphorylation process was not different
between the two genotypes. The luciferase assay using calvaria cells transfected 
with the Smad1 mutated as a constitutive active form showed increased
transcriptional activity at similar levels between the genotypes. The expression 
of BMP receptors was not different between the genotypes. BMP-induced
phosphorylation of Smad1/5 was robustly decreased in wild type cells, but not in 
mutant cells, by pretreatment with DB867, an inhibitor of methyltransferase of
inhibitory Smad6. Furthermore, BMP-induced translocation of Smad6 from nucleus to
cytosol was not much observed in PRIP-deficient cells. These results indicate
that PRIP is implicated in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation by the negative
regulation of Smad phosphorylation, through the methylation of inhibitory Smad6.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play vital roles in regulating stem cell
maintenance and differentiation. BMPs can induce osteogenesis and inhibit
myogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. Canonical BMP signaling is stringently
controlled through reversible phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of 
Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (Smad1/5/8). However, how the nuclear export of Smad1/5/8
is regulated remains unclear. Here we report that the Ran-binding protein RanBP3L
acts as a nuclear export factor for Smad1/5/8. RanBP3L directly recognizes
dephosphorylated Smad1/5/8 and mediates their nuclear export in a Ran-dependent
manner. Increased expression of RanBP3L blocks BMP-induced osteogenesis of mouse 
bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and promotes myogenic induction of
C2C12 mouse myoblasts, whereas depletion of RanBP3L expression enhances
BMP-dependent stem cell differentiation activity and transcriptional responses.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RanBP3L, as a nuclear exporter for
BMP-specific Smads, plays a critical role in terminating BMP signaling and
regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.

Skeletal regenerative medicine frequently incorporates deliverable growth factors
to stimulate osteogenesis. However, the cost and side effects secondary to
supraphysiologic dosages of growth factors warrant investigation of alternative
methods of stimulating osteogenesis for clinical utilization. In this work, we
describe growth factor independent osteogenic induction of human mesenchymal stem
cells (hMSCs) on a novel nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan
scaffold (MC-GAG). hMSCs demonstrated elevated osteogenic gene expression and
mineralization on MC-GAG with minimal to no effect upon addition of BMP-2 when
compared to non-mineralized scaffolds (Col-GAG). To investigate the intracellular
pathways responsible for the increase in osteogenesis, we examined the canonical 
and non-canonical pathways downstream from BMP receptor activation. Constitutive 
Smad1/5 phosphorylation with nuclear translocation occurred on MC-GAG independent
of BMP-2, whereas Smad1/5 phosphorylation depended on BMP-2 stimulation on
Col-GAG. When non-canonical BMPR signaling molecules were examined, ERK1/2
phosphorylation was found to be decreased in MC-GAG but elevated in Col-GAG. No
differences in Smad2/3 or p38 activation were detected. Collectively, these
results demonstrated that MC-GAG scaffolds induce osteogenesis without exogenous 
BMP-2 addition via endogenous activation of the canonical BMP receptor signaling 
pathway.

OBJECTIVE: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is reported to inhibit bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) signal transduction. MGP deficiency is associated with medial
calcification of the arterial wall, in a process that involves both osteogenic
transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and mesenchymal
transition of endothelial cells (EndMT). In this study, we investigated the
contribution of BMP signal transduction to the medial calcification that develops
in MGP-deficient mice.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: MGP-deficient mice (MGP(-/-)) were treated with one of two 
BMP signaling inhibitors, LDN-193189 or ALK3-Fc, beginning one day after birth.
Aortic calcification was assessed in 28-day-old mice by measuring the uptake of a
fluorescent bisphosphonate probe and by staining tissue sections with Alizarin
red. Aortic calcification was 80% less in MGP(-/-) mice treated with LDN-193189
or ALK3-Fc compared with vehicle-treated control animals (P<0.001 for both).
LDN-193189-treated MGP(-/-) mice survived longer than vehicle-treated MGP(-/-)
mice. Levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5 and Id1 mRNA (markers of BMP signaling)
did not differ in the aortas from MGP(-/-) and wild-type mice. Markers of EndMT
and osteogenesis were increased in MGP(-/-) aortas, an effect that was prevented 
by LDN-193189. Calcification of isolated VSMCs was also inhibited by LDN-193189.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of BMP signaling leads to reduced vascular calcification 
and improved survival in MGP(-/-) mice. The EndMT and osteogenic
transdifferentiation associated with MGP deficiency is dependent upon BMP
signaling. These results suggest that BMP signal transduction has critical roles 
in the development of vascular calcification in MGP-deficient mice.

Zirconium (Zr) is an element commonly used in dental and orthopedic implants
either as zirconia (ZrO2) or in metal alloys. It can also be incorporated into
calcium silicate-based ceramics. However, the effects of in vitro culture of
human osteoblasts (HOBs) with soluble ionic forms of Zr have not been determined.
In this study, primary culture of human osteoblasts was conducted in the presence
of medium containing either ZrCl4 or Zirconium (IV) oxynitrate (ZrO(NO3)2) at
concentrations of 0, 5, 50 and 500 µM, and osteoblast proliferation,
differentiation and calcium deposition were assessed. Incubation of human
osteoblast cultures with Zr ions increased the proliferation of human osteoblasts
and also gene expression of genetic markers of osteoblast differentiation. In 21 
and 28 day cultures, Zr ions at concentrations of 50 and 500 µM increased the
deposition of calcium phosphate. In addition, the gene expression of BMP2 and BMP
receptors was increased in response to culture with Zr ions and this was
associated with increased phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. Moreover, Noggin suppressed
osteogenic gene expression in HOBs co-treated with Zr ions. In conclusion, Zr
ions appear able to induce both the proliferation and the differentiation of
primary human osteoblasts. This is associated with up-regulation of BMP2
expression and activation of BMP signaling suggesting this action is, at least in
part, mediated by BMP signaling.

Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) play important roles in skeletal
development and bone fracture healing, yet how PDGFs execute their functions
remains incompletely understood. Here we show that PDGF-AA, but not -AB or -BB,
could activate the BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathway in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which 
requires BMPRIA as well as PDGFRα. PDGF-AA promotes MSC osteogenic
differentiation through the BMP-Smad1/5/8-Runx2/Osx axis and MSC migration via
the BMP-Smad1/5/8-Twist1/Atf4 axis. Mechanistic studies show that PDGF-AA
activates BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling by feedback down-regulating PDGFRα, which frees
BMPRI and allows for BMPRI-BMPRII complex formation to activate smad1/5/8, using 
BMP molecules in the microenvironment. This study unravels a physical and
functional interaction between PDGFRα and BMPRI, which plays an important role in
MSC differentiation and migration, and establishes a link between PDGF-AA and
BMPs pathways, two essential regulators of embryonic development and tissue
homeostasis.

U0126 has been reported as a specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, 
which plays a vital role during the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs). We report the positive effect of U0126 on the osteogenesis of 
rat MSCs. We find that U0126 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs 
as demonstrated by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for
osteogenic markers, alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium nodule formation.
Our data indicate that U0126 enhances the BMP/Smad signaling pathway in rat MSCs,
while inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, Western blot results 
demonstrate that U0126 increases Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation synergistically with
β-glycerophosphate. In addition, U0126 significantly increases the expression of 
BMP2 during the process of osteogenesis in rat MSCs and the level of
phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 is significantly reduced by BMP2 antibody, suggesting
that U0126 also promotes the expression of BMP2 to enhance Smad proteins
phosphorylation. Thus, we demonstrate a novel function for U0126 in promoting
osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs by the activation of the BMP/Smad
signaling pathway.

Angiogenesis is considered essential for proper bone regeneration. The purpose of
this investigation was to determine if a combined therapy of bone morphogenetic
protein-2 (BMP-2) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein angiopoietin-1
(COMP-Ang1) can potentiate the therapeutic effect of BMP-2 in a rat model of
ischemic necrosis of the femoral head (INFH). INFH was surgically induced in the 
femoral head of rats, and the animals were divided into the following groups: 1) 
a sham-operated group (sham group), 2) a bovine serum albumin-injected group (BSA
group), 3) a BMP-2-injected group (BMP-2 group), and 4) a COMP-Ang1 and
BMP-2-injected group (COMP-Ang1 + BMP-2 group) (n = 20/group). Radiologic,
histologic, and histomorphometric assessments were performed to assess femoral
head morphology, vascular density, and bone resorption activity. Western blots
and immunohistochemical staining were performed to evaluate production of
BMP-related signaling proteins in C3H10T1/2 cells and tissues. Real-time RT-PCR
was performed to investigate expression of the target integrin gene, and the
effect of integrin on C3H10T1/2 cells was determined using a cell adhesion assay.
Radiographs obtained six weeks after injection revealed better preservation of
the architecture of the femoral head in the COMP-Ang1 + BMP-2 group compared with
the BSA and BMP-2 groups. Histological findings indicated increased trabecular
bone and vascularity and decreased osteoclast bone resorption activity in the
COMP-Ang1 + BMP-2 group compared with those in the BSA and BMP-2 groups. The
combination of COMP-Ang1 and BMP-2 increased phosphorylation of Smad1/3/5, p38,
and Akt. Increased integrin α3 and β1 mRNA expression in the COMP-Ang1 + BMP-2
group promoted cell adhesion. These results suggest that COMP-Ang1 preserved the 
necrotic femoral head through the potentiation of BMP-2 signaling pathways and
angiogenesis. Combination treatment with COMP-Ang1 and BMP-2 may be a clinically 
useful therapeutic application in INFH.

is inhibited by the treatment of TNF-α in human adipose tissue-derived stromal
cells.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of BMP2 on
osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells
(hADSCs).
METHODS: Cultured cells were differentiated into osteogenic lineage in the
presence of BMP2. Gene expressions were determined by real time PCR.
RESULTS: BMP2 increased (2/8) or inhibited (6/8) osteogenic differentiation
according to hADSCs batches. Regardless of the BMP2 action on osteogenic
differentiation, BMP2 induced lipid droplet formation under an osteogenic
differentiation condition in all batches of hADSCs, not hBMSCs, to be tested,
which was confirmed by analysis of adipogenesis related genes expression. hADSCs 
expressed various BMP receptors. BMP2 increased expression of BMP2-responsive
genes such as DLX3 and ID2, and induced SMAD1 phosphorylation in hADSCs and
hBMSCs. BMP2 increased osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs in osteogenic medium 
in which dexamethasone was omitted. The addition of BMP2 in the control culture
media containing dexamethasone alone lead to formation of lipid droplets and
increased C/EBP-α expression in hADSCs. In the presence of TNF-α, BMP2 stimulated
osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs even in hADSCs batches in which treatment of
BMP2 alone inhibited osteogenic differentiation.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the control of osteogenesis and adipogenesis
in hADSCs is closely related, and that hADSCs have preferential commitment to
adipogenic lineages.

The process of vascular calcification shares many similarities with that of
physiological skeletal mineralization, and involves the deposition of
hydroxyapatite crystals in arteries. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible
have yet to be fully explained. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-9) has been shown
to exert direct effects on both bone development and vascular function. In the
present study, we have investigated the role of BMP-9 in vascular smooth muscle
cell (VSMC) calcification. Vessel calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
begins pre-dialysis, with factors specific to the dialysis milieu triggering
accelerated calcification. Intriguingly, BMP-9 was markedly elevated in serum
from CKD children on dialysis. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that BMP-9 
treatment causes a significant increase in VSMC calcium content, alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers.
BMP-9-induced calcium deposition was significantly reduced following treatment
with the ALP inhibitor 2,5-Dimethoxy-N-(quinolin-3-yl) benzenesulfonamide
confirming the mediatory role of ALP in this process. The inhibition of ALK1
signalling using a soluble chimeric protein significantly reduced calcium
deposition and ALP activity, confirming that BMP-9 is a physiological ALK1
ligand. Signal transduction studies revealed that BMP-9 induced Smad2, Smad3 and 
Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. As these Smad proteins directly bind to Smad4 to
activate target genes, siRNA studies were subsequently undertaken to examine the 
functional role of Smad4 in VSMC calcification. Smad4-siRNA transfection induced 
a significant reduction in ALP activity and calcium deposition. These novel data 
demonstrate that BMP-9 induces VSMC osteogenic differentiation and calcification 
via ALK1, Smad and ALP dependent mechanisms. This may identify new potential
therapeutic strategies for clinical intervention.

Cerium (Ce), one of the lanthanides (Ln), displays a variety of biochemical and
physiological effects. However, the potential effect and mechanism of Ce on bone 
metabolism are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the putative
role of Ce in regulating the migration and osteogenic differentiation of bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and the underlying mechanism. The results indicated 
that Ce promoted BMSCs viability and ALP activity at lower concentrations (0.001 
μM), and decreased the viability and ALP activity of BMSCs at higher
concentrations (10 μM). Ce could also affect the expression of osteogenic
transcription factors (Runx2, Satb2 and OCN) in BMSCs. Our results also showed
that Ce promoted migration of BMSCs by increasing SDF-1 mRNA expression. As the
Smad-dependent BMP signaling pathway plays an important role in migration and
osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, our results are in agreement with Ce
promoting the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and translocating to the nucleus by
increase BMP2 expression. The activity of p-Smad1/5/8 increased SDF-1 and Runx2
expression level in BMSCs. In conclusion, our results support the notion that Ce 
promoted migration and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs by Smad1/5/8 signaling
pathway.

Presence of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)
signalling has been proved in various peripheral tissues. PACAP can activate
protein kinase A (PKA) signalling via binding to pituitary adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1), vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide receptor (VPAC) 1 or VPAC2 receptor. Since little is known about the 
role of this regulatory mechanism in bone formation, we aimed to investigate the 
effect of PACAP on osteogenesis of UMR-106 cells. PACAP 1-38 as an agonist and
PACAP 6-38 as an antagonist of PAC1 were added to the culture medium.
Surprisingly, both substances enhanced protein expressions of collagen type I,
osterix and alkaline phosphatase, along with higher cell proliferation rate and
an augmented mineralisation. Although expression of PKA was elevated, no
alterations were detected in the expression, phosphorylation and nuclear presence
of CREB, but increased nuclear appearance of Runx2, the key transcription factor 
of osteoblast differentiation, was shown. Both PACAPs increased the expressions
of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2, 4, 6, 7 and Smad1 proteins, as well as
that of Sonic hedgehog, PATCH1 and Gli1. Data of our experiments indicate that
activation of PACAP pathway enhances bone formation of UMR-106 cells and PKA, BMP
and Hedgehog signalling pathways became activated. We also found that PACAP 6-38 
did not act as an antagonist of PACAP signalling in UMR-106 cells.

Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) stimulate bone formation in vivo and osteoblast 
differentiation in vitro via a Smad signaling pathway. Recent findings revealed
that the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibits BMP-induced osteoblast 
differentiation. Here, we show that NF-κB inhibits BMP signaling by directly
targeting the Smad pathway. A selective inhibitor of the classic NF-κB pathway,
BAY11-770682, enhanced BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation in vivo. In mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from mice deficient in p65, the main
subunit of NF-κB, BMP2, induced osteoblastic differentiation via the Smad complex
to a greater extent than that in wild-type MEFs. In p65(-/-) MEFs, the
BMP2-activated Smad complex bound much more stably to the target element than
that in wild-type MEFs without affecting the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8.
Overexpression of p65 inhibited BMP2 activity by decreasing the DNA binding of
the Smad complex. The C-terminal region, including the TA2 domain, of p65 was
essential for inhibiting the BMP-Smad pathway. The C-terminal TA2 domain of p65
associated with the MH1 domain of Smad4 but not Smad1. Taken together, our
results suggest that p65 inhibits BMP signaling by blocking the DNA binding of
the Smad complex via an interaction with Smad4. Our study also suggests that
targeting the association between p65 and Smad4 may help to promote bone
regeneration in the treatment of bone diseases.

periodontal ligament cells through activation of bone morphogenetic protein-smad 
signaling.

North St, Yubei District, 401147 Chongqing, China. soongjl@163.com.

OBJECTIVES: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (US) can accelerate fracture healing 
and osteogenic differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the
osteogenic effect of low-intensity pulsed US on human periodontal ligament cells 
and to determine whether bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-Smad signaling was
involved.
METHODS: Human periodontal ligament cells were exposed to low-intensity pulsed US
at a frequency of 1.5 MHz and intensity of 90 mW/cm(2) for 20 min/d. Osteogenic
differentiation was determined by assaying alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium
deposition. Expression of BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 was detected by real-time
polymerase chain reaction analysis. Phosphorylated Smad was detected by western
blotting; Smad in the cells was labeled by an immunofluorescent antibody and
observed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: The optical density of ALP stimulated by US at 1.5 MHz and 90 mW/cm(2)
for 20 min/d was significantly higher than in other groups (P < .01); therefore, 
this dosage was considered optimal for promoting osteogenic differentiation.
After 13 days of US exposure, ALP increased gradually after 5 days, peaked at 11 
days, and decreased at 13 days, with a significant difference compared with the
control group (P < .05). Osteocalcin production increased from 9 to 13 days and
peaked at 15 days, with a significant difference compared with the control group 
(P < .05). BMP-2 and BMP-6 increased dynamically after exposure for 13 days.
BMP-2 increased 6.07-fold at 3 days, 6.39-fold at 11 days, and 5.97-fold at 13
days. BMP-6 expression increased 6.82-fold at 1 day and 51.5-fold at 3 days and
decreased thereafter. BMP-9 was not expressed. Phospho-Smad1/5/8 expression was
significantly increased after exposure (P< .05) and transferred from the
cytoplasm into the nuclei.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-intensity pulsed US effectively induced osteogenic
differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells, and the BMP-Smad signaling
pathway was involved in the mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a key cytokine during
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMC). High phosphate induces a phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC) into osteogenic-like cells. This study was aimed to evaluate 
signaling pathways involved during VSMC differentiation of MSC in presence or not
of high phosphate.
RESULTS: Our results showed that TGF-β induced nuclear translocation of Smad3 as 
well as the expression of vascular smooth muscle markers, such as smooth muscle
alpha actin, SM22α, myocardin, and smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain. The addition
of high phosphate to MSC promoted nuclear translocation of Smad1/5/8 and the
activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin in addition to an increase in BMP-2
expression, calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity. The
administration of TGF-β to MSC treated with high phosphate abolished all these
effects by inhibiting canonical Wnt, BMP and TGF-β pathways. A similar outcome
was observed in high phosphate-treated cells after the inhibition of canonical
Wnt signaling with Dkk-1. Conversely, addition of both Wnt/β-catenin activators
CHIR98014 and lithium chloride enhanced the effect of high phosphate on BMP-2,
calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Full VSMC differentiation induced by TGF-β may not be achieved when 
extracellular phosphate levels are high. Moreover, TGF-β prevents high
phosphate-induced osteogenesis by decreasing the nuclear translocation of Smad
1/5/8 and avoiding the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Recombinant biglycan promotes bone morphogenetic protein-induced osteogenesis.

Chapel Hill, USA.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
glutathione-S-transferase-fused recombinant biglycan (GST-BGN) on craniofacial
bone regeneration. We recently demonstrated a positive effect of tissue-derived
BGN on bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) function, which is exerted likely via
the BGN core protein. Here, we investigated the effects of GST-BGN lacking any
posttranslational modifications on BMP-2 function in vitro and in vivo. In the
C2C12 cell culture system, BMP-2-induced Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation and alkaline 
phosphatase activity were both enhanced by the addition of GST-BGN. For the in
vivo effect, we employed a Sprague-Dawley rat mandible defect model utilizing 1
µg (optimal) or 0.1 µg (suboptimal) of BMP-2 combined with 0, 2, 4, or 8 µg of
GST-BGN. At 2 weeks post-surgery, newly formed bone was evaluated by
microcomputed tomography and histologic analyses. The results revealed that the
greatest amounts of bone within the defect were formed in the groups of
suboptimal BMP-2 combined with 4 or 8 µg of GST-BGN. Also, bone was well
organized versus that formed by the optimal dose of BMP. These results indicate
that recombinant BGN is an efficient substrate to promote low-dose BMP-induced
osteogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a frequent complication of modern
wartime extremity injuries. The biological mechanisms responsible for the
development of HO in traumatic wounds remain elusive.
QUESTION/PURPOSES: The aims of our study were to (1) characterize the expression 
profile of osteogenesis-related gene transcripts in traumatic war wounds in which
HO developed; and (2) determine whether expression at the mRNA level correlated
with functional protein expression and HO formation.
METHODS: Biopsy specimens from 54 high-energy penetrating extremity wounds
obtained at the initial and final surgical débridements were evaluated. The
levels of selected osteogenic-related gene transcripts from RNA extracts were
assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis. As a result of its key role in osteogenesis, the concentration of BMP-2
in the effluent of 29 wounds also was determined.
RESULTS: The transcripts of 13 genes (ALPL [p = 0.006], BMP-2 [p < 0.001], BMP-3

twofold in wounds in which HO developed compared with wounds in which it did not 
develop. Gene transcript expression of BMP-2 also correlated directly with
functional protein expression in the wounds that formed HO (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist in the osteogenic gene expression
profile of wounds in which HO developed compared with wounds in which it did not 
develop. The upregulation of multiple osteogenesis-related gene transcripts
indicates the presence of a proosteogenic environment necessary for ectopic bone 
formation in traumatic wounds.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the osteogenic environment associated with war 
wounds may allow for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for HO.

Osteoporotic fractures show reduced callus formation and delayed bone healing.
Cellular sources of fracture healing are mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that
differentiate into osteoblasts by stimulation with osteoinductive cytokines, such
as BMP-2. We hypothesized that impaired signal transduction and reduced
osteogenic differentiation capacity in response to BMP-2 may underlie the delayed
fracture healing. Therefore, MSC were isolated from femoral heads of healthy and 
osteoporotic patients. Grouping was carried out by bone mineral densitometry in
an age-matched manner. MSC were stimulated with BMP-2. Signal transduction was
assessed by western blotting of pSMAD1/5/8 and pERK1/2 as well as by quantitative
RT-PCR of Runx-2, Dlx5, and Osteocalcin. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed 
by quantifying Alizarin Red staining. Osteoporotic MSC featured an accurate
phosphorylation pattern of SMAD1/5/8 but a significantly reduced activation of
ERK1/2 by BMP-2 stimulation. Furthermore, osteoporotic MSC showed significantly
reduced basal expression levels of Runx-2 and Dlx5. However, Runx-2, Dlx5, and
Osteocalcin expression showed adequate up-regulation due to BMP-2 stimulation.
The global osteogenic differentiation in standard osteogenic differentiation
media was reduced in osteoporotic MSC. Nevertheless, osteoporotic MSC were shown 
to feature an adequate induction of osteogenic differentiation due to BMP-2
stimulation. Taken together, we here demonstrate osteoporosis associated
alterations in BMP-2 signaling but sustained specific osteogenic differentiation 
capacity in response to BMP-2. Therefore, BMP-2 may represent a promising
therapeutic agent for the treatment of fractures in osteoporotic patients.

Co-stimulation with bone morphogenetic protein-9 and FK506 induces remarkable
osteoblastic differentiation in rat dedifferentiated fat cells.

Dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells, which are isolated from mature adipocytes
using the ceiling culture method, exhibit similar characteristics to mesenchymal 
stem cells, and possess adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic
potentials. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and -9, members of the
transforming growth factor-β superfamily, exhibit the most potent osteogenic
activity of this growth factor family. However, the effects of BMP-2 and BMP-9 on
the osteogenic differentiation of DFAT remain unknown. Here, we examined the
effects of BMP-2 and BMP-9 on osteoblastic differentiation of rat DFAT (rDFAT)
cells in the presence or absence of FK506, an immunosuppressive agent.
Co-stimulation with BMP-9 and FK506 induced gene expression of runx2, osterix,
and bone sialoprotein, and ALP activity compared with BMP-9 alone, BMP-2 alone
and BMP-2+FK506 in rDFAT cells. Furthermore, it caused mineralization of cultures
and phosphorylation of smad1/5/8, compared with BMP-9 alone. The ALP activity
induced by BMP-9+FK506 was not influenced by addition of noggin, a BMP
antagonist. Our data suggest that the combination of BMP-9 and FK506 potently
induces osteoblastic differentiation of rDFAT cells.

Biocompatibility testing of single-walled carbon nanotubes on murine
preosteoblasts: higher osteoblastic differentiation with BMP-9 than with BMP-2.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used in orthopaedic applications because of
their exceptional mechanical properties. However, the influence of CNTs on the
behaviour of bone-forming cells and on the ability of these cells to respond to
growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), remains poorly known.
Therefore, in the present study, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) were synthesised
using an induction thermal plasma process and purified using a multistep
procedure. The impact of these purified SWCNTs on the Smad activation, cell
proliferation and differentiation, with or without BMP-2 and BMP-9 (1.92 nM), was
also studied using western blot, mitochondrial enzymatic activity, TUNEL, RT-PCR 
and alkaline phosphatase activity analyses. Pre-treatment of MC3T3-E1
preosteoblasts with SWCNTs accelerated the Smad1/5/8 activation, induced by both 
BMP-2 and BMP-9, within 15 min. It also slightly affected their proliferation at 
48 h without apoptosis. Interestingly, at 72 h, BMP-9 favoured the
differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts pretreated with SWCNTs to a larger
extent than BMP-2 did. Therefore, the combination of BMP-9 with SWCNTs appears to
be a promising avenue for bone applications.

osseous regeneration.

Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of murine anti-BMP-2 monoclonal
antibodies (mAb) immobilized on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) to mediate de
novo bone formation, a process termed antibody-mediated osseous regeneration
(AMOR). The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of a newly
generated chimeric anti-BMP-2 mAb in mediating AMOR, as well as to evaluate the
suitability of different biomaterials as scaffolds to participate in AMOR.
Chimeric anti-BMP-2 mAb was immobilized on 4 biomaterials, namely, titanium
microbeads (Ti), alginate hydrogel, macroporous biphasic calcium phosphate (MBCP)
and ACS, followed by surgical implantation into rat critical-size calvarial
defects. Animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks and the degree of bone fill was
assessed using micro-CT and histomorphometry. Results demonstrated local
persistence of chimeric anti-BMP-2 mAb up to 8 weeks, as well as significant de
novo bone regeneration in sites implanted with chimeric anti-BMP-2 antibody
immobilized on each of the 4 scaffolds. Ti and MBCP showed the highest volume of 
bone regeneration, presumably due to their resistance to compression. Alginate
and ACS also mediated de novo bone formation, though significant volumetric
shrinkage was noted. In vitro assays demonstrated cross-reactivity of chimeric
anti-BMP-2 mAb with BMP-4 and BMP-7. Immune complex of anti-BMP-2 mAb with BMP-2 
induced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells in vitro, involving expression 
of RUNX2 and phosphorylation of Smad1. The present data demonstrated the ability 
of chimeric anti-BMP-2 mAb to functionalize different biomaterial with varying
characteristics to mediate osteogenesis.

FAD104, a regulatory factor of adipogenesis, acts as a novel regulator of
calvarial bone formation.

Osteogenesis is a complex process that is orchestrated by several growth factors,
extracellular cues, signaling molecules, and transcriptional factors.
Understanding the mechanisms of bone formation is pivotal for clarifying the
pathogenesis of bone diseases. Previously, we reported that fad104 (factor for
adipocyte differentiation 104), a novel positive regulator of adipocyte
differentiation, negatively regulated the differentiation of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts into osteocytes. However, the physiological role of fad104 in bone
formation has not been elucidated. Here, we clarified the role of fad104 in bone 
formation in vivo and in vitro. fad104 disruption caused craniosynostosis-like
premature ossification of the calvarial bone. Furthermore, analyses using primary
calvarial cells revealed that fad104 negatively regulated differentiation and
BMP/Smad signaling pathway. FAD104 interacted with Smad1/5/8. The N-terminal
region of FAD104, which contains a proline-rich motif, was capable of binding to 
Smad1/5/8. We demonstrated that down-regulation of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation by
FAD104 is dependent on the N-terminal region of FAD104 and that fad104 functions 
as a novel negative regulator of BMP/Smad signaling and is required for proper
development for calvarial bone. These findings will aid a comprehensive
description of the mechanism that controls normal and premature calvarial
ossification.

Lacunocanalicular fluid flow transduces mechanical tension stress during
distraction osteogenesis.

Author information:

Center, New York, New York.

The mechanotransduction mechanisms linking distraction device activation to new
bone formation remain unknown. We hypothesize that the tension stress of
activation during distraction osteogenesis is transmitted through
lacunocanalicular fluid flow to initiate the osteogenic signaling cascade. Adult 
Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 24) were subjected to mandibular osteotomy and
application of an external distraction device. After a 3-day latency period, half
the animals (n = 12) underwent device activation at 0.25 mm twice daily for 6
days (total activation, 3 mm), and the other half (n = 12) had no activation. On 
day 10, the animals were injected with fluorescent reactive red lacunocanalicular
tracer before killing. Mandibles were harvested, embedded, and sectioned, and
reactive red epifluorescence lacunocanalicular flow was measured. Protein was
harvested for focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1), NESPRIN1, SUN1, LAMIN A/C, and
SMAD1 Western blotting as well as for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and alkaline phosphatase assay.
Lacunocanalicular fluid flow was significantly greater in the distracted samples 
(60.5 ± 14 vs 10.3 ± 4 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome per
megapixel, P = 0.01). Flow distribution demonstrated the highest
lacunocanalicular flow near the center of the distraction gap. Increased
lacunocanalicular flow resulted in increased FAK1 (P = 0.009), NESPRIN1 (P =
0.01), SUN1 (P = 0.01), and LAMIN A/C (P = 0.008) expression. Focal adhesion
kinase 1 activation in the presence of BMP-2 protein expression (P = 0.001)
resulted in increased intranuclear SMAD1 phosphorylation (P = 0.04) and alkaline 
phosphatase activity (P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that activation of the 
distraction osteogenesis device affects cellular response through changes in
lacunocanalicular fluid flow.

Role of interleukin-10 in endochondral bone formation in mice: anabolic effect
via the bone morphogenetic protein/Smad pathway.

Jung YK(1), Kim GW, Park HR, Lee EJ, Choi JY, Beier F, Han SW.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine with
a chondroprotective effect that is elevated in cartilage and synovium in patients
with osteoarthritis. However, the role of IL-10 during endochondral bone
formation and its mechanism of action have not been elucidated.
METHODS: IL-10(-/-) mice and IL-10-treated tibial organ cultures were used to
study loss and gain of IL-10 functions, respectively, during endochondral bone
formation. Primary chondrocytes from the long bones of mouse embryos were
cultured with and without IL-10. To assess the role of IL-10 in chondrogenic
differentiation, we conducted mesenchymal cell micromass cultures.
RESULTS: The lengths of whole skeletons from IL-10(-/-) mice were similar to
those of their wild-type littermates, although their skull diameters were
smaller. The tibial growth plates of IL-10(-/-) mice showed shortening of the
proliferating zone. Treatment with IL-10 significantly increased tibial lengths
in organ culture. IL-10 also induced chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophic
differentiation in primary chondrocytes in vitro. Mechanistically, IL-10
activated STAT-3 and the Smad1/5/8 and ERK-1/2 MAP kinase pathways and induced
the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and BMP-6 in primary
chondrocytes. Furthermore, the blocking of BMP signaling attenuated the
IL-10-mediated induction of cyclin D1 and RUNX-2 in primary chondrocytes and
suppressed Alcian blue and alkaline phosphatase staining in mesenchymal cell
micromass cultures.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IL-10 acts as a stimulator of chondrocyte
proliferation and chondrogenic or hypertrophic differentiation via activation of 
the BMP signaling pathway.

differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into osteogenic,
chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic lineages. It's reported that bone
morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is one of the most potent osteogenic BMPs to
initiate the commitment of MSCs to osteoblast lineage. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
is critical for bone fracture healing and osteogenic differentiation in MSCs.
However, the relationship between COX-2 and BMP9 in osteogenesis remains unknown.
Herein, we investigate the role of COX-2 in BMP9-induced osteogenesis in MSCs. We
demonstrate that COX-2 is up-regulated as a target of BMP9 in MSCs. Both COX-2
inhibitor (NS-398) and COX-2 knockdown siRNAs can effectively decrease alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activities induced by BMP9 in MSCs. NS-398 also down-regulates 
BMP9-induced expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin, so does the matrix
mineralization. The in vivo studies indicate that knockdown of COX-2 attenuates
BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation. In perinatal limb culture assay, NS-398 is
shown to reduce the hypertropic chondrocyte zone and ossification induced by
BMP9. Mechanistically, knockdown of COX-2 significantly inhibits the BMP9
up-regulated expression of Runx2 and Dlx-5 in MSCs, which can be rescued by
exogenous expression of COX-2. Furthermore, knockdown of COX-2 apparently reduces
BMP9 induced BMPR-Smad reporter activity, the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and
the expression of Smad6 and Smad7 in MSCs. NS-398 blocks the expression of BMP9
mediated by BMP9 recombinant adenovirus. Taken together, our findings suggest
that COX-2 plays an important role in BMP9 induced osteogenic differentiation in 
MSCs; BMP9 and COX-2 may form an important regulatory loop to orchestrate the
osteogenic differentiation in MSCs.

BMP-2 induced early bone formation in spine fusion using rat ovariectomy
osteoporosis model.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) enhance bone formation.
Numerous animal studies have established that BMPs can augment spinal fusion.
However, there is a lack of data on the effect of BMP-2 on spinal fusion in the
osteoporotic spine.
PURPOSE: To investigate whether recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) enhances spine 
fusion in an ovariectomized rat model.
STUDY DESIGN: In vivo animal study.
METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=60) were ovariectomized or sham operated
and randomized into three groups: Sham (sham operated+fusion), ovariectomy (OVX) 
(OVX+fusion), and BMP (OVX+fusion+BMP-2). Six weeks after ovariectomy, unilateral
lumbar spine fusion was performed using autologous iliac bone with/without
rhBMP-2 delivered on a collagen matrix. For each group, gene expression and
histology were evaluated at 3 and 6 weeks after fusion, and bone parameters were 
measured by microcomputed tomography at 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction at 3 weeks
showed markedly increased expression of osteoblast-related markers (namely
alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, Runx2, Smad1, and Smad5) in the BMP group
compared with the other groups (p=.0005, .0005, .003, .009 and .012,
respectively). Although the Sham and OVX groups showed both sparse and compacted 
bones between transverse processes at 6 weeks, the BMP group had a significantly 
larger bone mass within the fusion bed at 3 weeks and later. All rats in the BMP 
group had bridging bone at 3 weeks; at 12 weeks, bridging bones in the Sham and
OVX groups were about 50% and 25%, respectively, of that in the BMP group.
CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant human BMP-2 enhances spinal fusion in OVX rats and acts 
during early bone formation. Therapeutic BMP-2 may therefore improve the outcome 
of spinal fusion in the osteoporotic patient.

Enamel matrix derivative: protein components and osteoinductive properties.

MA, Gemperli AC, Cochran DL, Deas DE, Harris SE.

Base, San Antonio, TX.

BACKGROUND: Although enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has demonstrated the ability 
to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, the specific 
elements within the EMD compound responsible for these effects remain unknown.
METHODS: Nine different protein pools from a commercially produced EMD were
collected based on molecular weight. Six of these pools, along with the complete 
EMD unfractionated compound and positive and negative controls, were tested for
their ability to induce bone formation in a calvarial induction assay.
Immunocytochemistry of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 (phospho-SMAD), osterix, and
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was carried out at selected time
points. Finally, proteomic analysis was completed to determine the specific
protein-peptide content of the various osteoinductive pools.
RESULTS: One of the lower-molecular-weight pools tested, pool 7, showed bone
induction responses significantly greater than those of the other pools and the
complete EMD compound and was concentration dependent. Dynamic bone formation
rate analysis demonstrated that pool 7 was optimally active at the 5- to 10-μg
concentration. It was demonstrated that EMD and pool 7 induced phospho-SMAD,
osterix, and VEGF-A, which is indicative of increased bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) signaling. Proteomic composition analysis demonstrated that pool 7 had the 
highest concentration of the biologically active amelogenin-leucine-rich
amelogenin peptide and ameloblastin 17-kDa peptides.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the low-molecular-weight protein
pools (7 to 17 kDa) within EMD have greater osteoinductive potential than the
commercially available complete EMD compound and that the mechanism of action, in
part, is through increased BMP signaling and increased osterix and VEGF-A. With
this information, selected components of EMD can now be formulated for optimal
osteo- and angio-genesis.

Fluoride promotes viability and differentiation of osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells
via BMP/Smads signaling pathway.

The BMP/Smad signaling pathway plays an important role in the viability and
differentiation of osteoblast; however, it is not clear whether this pathway is
involved in the fluoride-induced osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we
investigated the role of BMP/Smad signaling pathway in fluoride-induced
osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells differentiation. Cells were exposed to fluoride of
different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mM), and cell
proliferation was determined using WST assays. The expression of osteoblast
marker genes such as osteocalcin (BGP) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) were 
detected by qRT-PCR. We found that fluoride enhanced the proliferation of Saos-2 
cells in a dose-dependent manner and 0.2 mM of fluoride resulted in a higher
expression of osteoblast marker genes. In addition, immunofluorescence analysis
showed that the promotion effects of 0.2 mM of fluoride on Saos-2 cells
differentiation were associated with the activation of the BMP/Smad pathway.
Expression of phosphorylated Smad1/5(p-Smad1/5) was higher in cells exposed to
0.2 mM of fluoride. Plasmid expression vectors encoding the short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) targeting Smad4 gene were used to block the BMP/Smad pathway, which
resulted in a significantly reduced expression of BGP and BALP as well as their
corresponding mRNA. The mRNA levels after transfection remained low even in the
presence of fluoride. The present results reveal that BMP/Smad signaling pathway 
was altered during the period of osteogenesis, and that the activities of
p-Smad1/5 were required for Saos-2 cells viability and differentiation induced by
fluoride.

Enhanced BMP signaling prevents degeneration and leads to endochondral
ossification of Meckel's cartilage in mice.

Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, PR China.

Meckel's cartilage is a transient supporting tissue of the embryonic mandible in 
mammals, and disappears by taking different ultimate cell fate along the
distal-proximal axis, with the majority (middle portion) undergoing degeneration 
and chondroclastic resorption. While a number of factors have been implicated in 
the degeneration and resorption processes, signaling pathways that trigger this
degradation are currently unknown. BMP signaling has been implicated in almost
every step of chondrogenesis. In this study, we used Noggin mutant mice as a
model for gain-of-BMP signaling function to investigate the function of BMP
signaling in Meckel's cartilage development, with a focus on the middle portion. 
We showed that Bmp2 and Bmp7 are expressed in early developing Meckels'
cartilage, but their expression disappears thereafter. In contrast, Noggin is
expressed constantly in Meckel's cartilage throughout the entire gestation
period. In the absence of Noggin, Meckel's cartilage is significantly thickened
attributing to dramatically elevated cell proliferation rate associated with
enhanced phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 expression. Interestingly, instead of taking a 
degeneration fate, the middle portion of Meckel's cartilage in Noggin mutants
undergoes chondrogenic differentiation and endochondral ossification contributing
to the forming mandible. Chondrocyte-specific expression of a constitutively
active form of BMPRIa but not BMPRIb leads to enlargement of Meckel's cartilage, 
phenocopying the consequence of Noggin deficiency. Our results demonstrate that
elevated BMP signaling prevents degeneration and leads to endochondral
ossification of Meckel's cartilage, and support the idea that withdrawal of BMP
signaling is required for normal Meckel's cartilage development and ultimate cell
fate.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors and can differentiate
into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages. Bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs) play important roles in stem cell proliferation and
differentiation. We recently demonstrated that BMP9 is a potent but less
understood osteogenic factor. We previously found that BMP9-induced ectopic bone 
formation is not inhibited by BMP3. Here, we investigate the effect of BMP
antagonist noggin on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. BMP antagonists
noggin, chording, gremlin, follistatin, and BMP3 are highly expressed in MSCs,
while noggin and follistatin are lowly expressed in more differentiated
pre-osteoblast C2C12 cells. BMP9-induced osteogenic markers and matrix
mineralization are not inhibited by noggin, while noggin blunts BMP2, BMP4, BMP6,
and BMP7-induced osteogenic markers and mineralization. Likewise, ectopic bone
formation by MSCs transduced with BMP9, but not the other four BMPs, is resistant
to noggin inhibition. BMP9-induced nuclear translocation of Smad1/5/8 is not
affected by noggin, while noggin blocks BMP2-induced activation of Smad1/5/8 in
MSCs. Noggin fails to inhibit BMP9-induced expression of downstream targets in
MSCs. Thus, our results strongly suggest that BMP9 may effectively overcome
noggin inhibition, which should at least in part contribute to BMP9's potent
osteogenic capability in MSCs.

OBJECTIVES: Titanium implant surfaces with modified topographies have improved
osteogenic properties in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms remain obscure. 
This study explored the signaling pathways responsible for the pro-osteogenic
properties of micro-roughened (SLA) and chemically/nanostructurally (modSLA)
modified titanium surfaces on human alveolar bone-derived osteoprogenitor cells
(BCs) in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activation of stem cell signaling pathways (TGFβ/BMP, 
Wnt, FGF, Hedgehog, Notch) was investigated following early exposure (24 and
72 h) of BCs to SLA and modSLA surfaces in the absence of osteogenic cell culture
supplements.
RESULTS: Key regulatory genes from the TGFβ/BMP (TGFBR2, BMPR2, BMPR1B, ACVR1B,
SMAD1, SMAD5), Wnt (Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/Ca(2+) ) (FZD1, FZD3, FZD5, LRP5,
NFATC1, NFATC2, NFATC4, PYGO2, LEF1) and Notch (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH4, PSEN1,
PSEN2, PSENEN) pathways were upregulated on the modified surfaces. These findings
correlated with a higher expression of osteogenic markers bone sialoprotein
(IBSP) and osteocalcin (BGLAP), and bone differentiation factors BMP2, BMP6, and 
GDF15, as observed on the modified surfaces.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the activation of the pro-osteogenic
cell signaling pathways by modSLA and SLA surfaces leads to enhanced osteogenic
differentiation as evidenced after 7 and 14 days culture in osteogenic media and 
provides a mechanistic insight into the superior osseointegration on the modified
surfaces observed in vivo.

stem cells through bone morphogenetic protein-2/Smad signaling pathway].

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether strontium ranelate (Sr) promotes osteoblast lineage
differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through the bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)/Smad signaling pathway.
METHODS: Cultured rat BMSCs were exposed to different concentrations of Sr,
noggin (an inhibitor of BMP-2) or Smad1 siRNA. The activity of alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) in the exposed cells was detected by colorimetry, and the
formation of mineralized nodules was observed with alizarin red staining. The
expressions of phosphorylated (p) Smad1/5/8 and Runt-related transcription factor
2 (Runx2) in the cells were detected by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Exposure to Sr at 0.1 to 10 mmol/L for 1 h markedly increased the
expression of p-Smad1/5/8 in the BMSCs, and the increment was the most obvious
following 1 mmol/L Sr exposure. Preconditioning with 100 ng/ml noggin for 2 h
inhibited Sr-induced up-regulation of p-Smad1/5/8 expressions. Exposure of the
cells to 0.1 to 5 mmol/L Sr for 6 h significantly enhanced Runx2 expression, and 
the peak enhancement occurred following 1 mmol/L Sr exposure. Transfection of the
BMSCs with Smad1 siRNA decreased the basal level of Smad1/5/8 protein expression,
and also inhibited Sr-induced up-regulation of p-Smad1/5/8 and Runx2 expressions 
as well as Sr-induced enhancement of ALP activity and formation of mineralized
nodules.
CONCLUSION: The BMP-2/Smad pathway is involved in Sr-induced osteoblast
differentiation of rat BMSCs.

In bone tissue engineering, a combination of biomimetic nanofibrous scaffolds
with renewable stem cells has recently emerged as a new strategy for promoting
bone regeneration. We have previously developed a biomimetic nanocomposite
nanofibrous scaffold of hydroxyapatite/chitosan (nHAp/CTS) [1]. However, the
mechanism behind the supportive function of the scaffolds has not yet been
adequately explored. Here, we evaluated the effect of nHAp/CTS seeded with bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on bone regeneration and examined the
underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The scaffolds of nHAp/CTS induced
higher proliferation of BMSCs than membranous hydroxyapatite/chitosan (mHAp/CTS) 
and electrospun nanofibrous chitosan (nCTS) did. Interestingly, regardless the
nanfibrous effect, nHAp/CTS and mHAp/CTS supported the spindle-shaped morphology,
in contrast to the spherical shape of BMSCs on nCTS, indicating that HAp supports
cell adhesion. Furthermore, the levels of the mRNA for Smad1, BMP-2/4, Runx2,
ALP, collagen I, integrin subunits together with myosins were significantly
up-regulated on nHAp/CTS whereas these genes were expressed at markedly low
levels on mHAp/CTS and nCTS even in osteogenic medium. In addition, the critical 
proteins pSmad1/5/8 in BMP pathway showed clear nuclear localization and
osteocalcin were significantly elevated on nHAp/CTS than mHAp/CTS (P < 0.01) and 
nCTS (P < 0.01). Similarly, the cells exhibited higher ALP activity on nHAp/CTS
than mHAp/CTS (P < 0.01) and nCTS (P < 0.05). Therefore, the findings indicated
the activating of intergrin-BMP/Smad signaling pathway of BMSCs on nHAp/CTS.
Finally, in vivo, nHAp/CTS/BMSCs had a superior ability of bone reconstruction
than other groups for cranial bone defects. In conclusion, our results
demonstrated that nHAp/CTS scaffold promotes bone regeneration by supporting the 
adhesion, proliferation and activating integrin-BMP/Smad signaling pathway of
BMSCs both in vitro and in vivo.

Surgery, University of California Davis, 4635 Second Avenue, Sacramento, CA

Lifestyle-related diseases are increasing and the challenge to create innovative 
drugs to treat such diseases is a main focus in medical science research.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a powerful modulator of glucose and lipid 
metabolism, and is an innovative candidate drug already in clinical trials for
type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Bone fragility and impaired fracture
healing induced by such lifestyle-related conditions are also a growing problem. 
Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are well known osteogenic growth factors, and
BMP-2 is used to augment bone formation in difficult clinical situations. There
are many documented interactions between the FGF and BMP family proteins,
although the interaction between FGF21 and BMP-2 remains unknown. The aim of this
study was to reveal the effect of FGF21 toward BMP-2-dependent osteogenic
activity, using C2C12 cells as a model system. We found that FGF21 enhanced
BMP-2-dependent transcription and osteogenesis in the C2C12 cell line, which was 
confirmed by alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix mineralization, and gene
expression. Mechanistically, FGF21 enhanced BMP-2-induced intracellular signaling
through Smad proteins, but not through p44/42MAPK proteins. Furthermore, we
identified a negative feedback loop in which BMP-2 decreased endogenous FGF21
mRNA expression. In summary, this study demonstrates interactions between BMP-2
and FGF21 pathways exist in vitro, and that FGF21 enhances the osteogenic
activity of BMP-2 by up-regulating the BMP-2-dependent Smad signaling pathway.

Foxc1 controls the growth of the murine frontal bone rudiment by direct
regulation of a Bmp response threshold of Msx2.

The mammalian skull vault consists of several intricately patterned bones that
grow in close coordination. The growth of these bones depends on the precise
regulation of the migration and differentiation of osteogenic cells from
undifferentiated precursor cells located above the eye. Here, we demonstrate a
role for Foxc1 in modulating the influence of Bmp signaling on the expression of 
Msx2 and the specification of these cells. Inactivation of Foxc1 results in a
dramatic reduction in skull vault growth and causes an expansion of Msx2
expression and Bmp signaling into the area occupied by undifferentiated precursor
cells. Foxc1 interacts directly with a Bmp responsive element in an enhancer
upstream of Msx2, and acts to reduce the occupancy of P-Smad1/5/8. We propose
that Foxc1 sets a threshold for the Bmp-dependent activation of Msx2, thus
controlling the differentiation of osteogenic precursor cells and the rate and
pattern of calvarial bone development.

Addition of bone morphogenetic protein type 2 to ascorbate and β-glycerophosphate
supplementation did not enhance osteogenic differentiation of human
adipose-derived stem cells.

SC, Brazil.

Bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP-2) is a potent local factor, which
promotes bone formation and has been used as an osteogenic supplement for
mesenchymal stem cells.OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effect of a
recombinant BMP-2 as well as the endogenous BMP-4 and BMP-7 in the osteogenic
differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in medium supplemented with 
ascorbate and β-glycerophosphate.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human ASCs were treated with osteogenic medium in the
presence (ASCs+OM+BMP-2) or absence (ASCs+OM) of BMP-2. The alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) activity was determined and the extracellular matrix mineralization was
evaluated by Von Kossa staining and calcium quantification. The expressions of
BMP-4, BMP-7, Smad1, Smad4, and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 were analyzed by western
blotting. Relative mRNA expressions of Smad1, BMP receptor type II (BMPR-II),
osteonectin, and osteocalcin were evaluated by qPCR.
RESULTS: ASCs+OM demonstrated the highest expression of BMP-4 and BMP-7 at days
21 and 7, respectively, the highest levels of BMPR-II mRNA expression at day 28, 
and the highest levels of Smad1 mRNA at days 14 and 28. ASCs+OM+BMP-2
demonstrated the highest levels of Smad1 mRNA expression at days 1, 7, and 21,
the highest expression of Smad1 at day 7, the highest expression of Smad4 at day 
14, the highest ALP activity at days 14 and 21, and expression of phosphorylated 
Smad1/5/8 at day 7. ASCs+OM and ASCs+OM+BMP2 showed similar ALP activity at days 
7 and 28, similar osteonectin and osteocalcin mRNA expression at all time
periods, and similar calcium depositions at all time periods.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that human ASCs expressed endogenous BMP-4 and BMP-7.
Moreover, the supplementation of ASCs with BMP-2 did not increase the level of
osteogenic markers in the initial (ALP activity), intermediate (osteonectin and
osteocalcin), or final (calcium deposition) phases, suggesting that the exogenous
addition of BMP-2 did not improve the in vitro osteogenesis process of human
ASCs.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multifunctional cytokines that belong to
the transforming growth factor-β family. BMPs were originally identified based on
their unique activity, inducing heterotopic bone formation in skeletal muscle.
This unique BMP activity is transduced by specific type I and type II
transmembrane kinase receptors. Among the downstream pathways activated by these 
receptors, the Smad1/5/8 transcription factors appear to play critical roles in
BMP activity. Smad1/5/8 transcription factors are phosphorylated at the
C-terminal SVS motif by BMP type I receptors and then induce the transcription of
early BMP-responsive genes by binding to conserved sequences in their enhancer
regions. The linker regions of Smad1/5/8 contain multiple kinase phosphorylation 
sites, and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these sites regulate the
transcriptional activity of Smad proteins. Gain-of-function mutations in one BMP 
type I receptor have been identified in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans
progressiva, a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by progressive
heterotopic bone formation in the skeletal muscle. The mutant receptors activate 
the Smad signaling pathway even in the absence of BMPs, therefore novel
inhibitors for the BMP receptor - Smad axis are being developed to prevent
heterotopic bone formation in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Taken
together, the data in the literature show that the BMP type I receptor - Smad
signaling axis is the critical pathway for the unique activity of BMPs and is a
potential therapeutic target for pathological conditions caused by inappropriate 
BMP activity.

To date, parathyroid hormone is the only clinically available bone anabolic drug.
The major difficulty in the development of such drugs is the lack of
clarification of the mechanisms regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone
formation. Here, we report a peptide (W9) known to abrogate osteoclast
differentiation in vivo via blocking receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB
ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling that we surprisingly found exhibits a bone anabolic
effect in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of W9 three times/day for 5 days
significantly augmented bone mineral density in mouse cortical bone.
Histomorphometric analysis showed a decrease in osteoclastogenesis in the distal 
femoral metaphysis and a significant increase in bone formation in the femoral
diaphysis. Our findings suggest that W9 exerts bone anabolic activity. To clarify
the mechanisms involved in this activity, we investigated the effects of W9 on
osteoblast differentiation/mineralization in MC3T3-E1 (E1) cells. W9 markedly
increased alkaline phosphatase (a marker enzyme of osteoblasts) activity and
mineralization as shown by alizarin red staining. Gene expression of several
osteogenesis-related factors was increased in W9-treated E1 cells. Addition of W9
activated p38 MAPK and Smad1/5/8 in E1 cells, and W9 showed osteogenesis
stimulatory activity synergistically with BMP-2 in vitro and ectopic bone
formation. Knockdown of RANKL expression in E1 cells reduced the effect of W9.
Furthermore, W9 showed a weak effect on RANKL-deficient osteoblasts in alkaline
phosphatase assay. Taken together, our findings suggest that this peptide may be 
useful for the treatment of bone diseases, and W9 achieves its bone anabolic
activity through RANKL on osteoblasts accompanied by production of several
autocrine factors.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the osteogenic differentiation
human dental follicle cells (hDFCs) cultured with in osteogenic induction medium 
(OIM) without dexamethasone (DEX), and to analyze the gene expression profile
during osteogenic differentiation.
METHODS: hDFCs, which isolated from dental follicle tissue from impacted third
molar teeth, were cultured with OIM with or without DEX. Osteogenic
differentiation of hDFCs was examined using Alkaline phosphatase activity and
Arizarin red staining. Gene expression analysis was performed by Microarray and
real time-PCR.
RESULTS: We showed that hDFCs have the capacity to differentiate into osteogenic 
lineages in osteogenic induction medium lacking DEX. We also analyzed gene
expression profiling of hDFCs during osteogenic differentiation. BMP6 is
up-regulated in both the presence and absence of DEX. In addition, BMP6 enhances 
gene expression levels of DLX-5, Runx2, and Osterix, which are transcription
factors associated with osteogenic differentiation. BMP6 also stimulates
phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 which are transcription factors associated with BMP 
signalling at protein levels. Additionally BMP6 stimulates mineralization of
hDFCs monolayers examined by Arizarin red S staining.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that hDFCs can differentiate to osteogenic
lineage cells osteogenic induction medium without DEX, and BMP6 is a key gene in 
the osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs, and has therapeutic utility for bone
regeneration and bone research.

Effect of BMP-2 from matrices of different stiffnesses for the modulation of stem
cell fate.

Stem cells cultured on extracellular matrix (ECM) with different stiffnesses have
been shown to engage into different lineage commitments. However, in vivo, the
components of the ECM are known to bind and strongly interact with growth
factors. The effect, on the stem cell fate, of the cooperation between the
mechanical properties and the growth factor in the same microenvironment has not 
yet been investigated. Here, we propose a protocol for mimicking this stem cell
microenvironment with an in vitro system. This system consists in grafting
(without using a spacer) biomolecules that contain N-termini groups onto hydrogel
(poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid)) surfaces of various stiffnesses ranging from
0.5 to 70 kPa. First, we demonstrate that the commitment of mesenchymal stem cell
populations changes in response to the substrate's rigidity, with myogenic
differentiation occurring at 13-17 kPa and osteogenic differentiation at 45-49
kPa. Chemical grafting of soft and stiff matrices with an osteogenic factor
(BMP-2(mimetic peptide)) results only in osteogenic differentiation. Also, when
grafted on even softer gels (0.5-3.5 kPa), the BMP-2(mimetic peptide) had no
effect on the stem cell differentiation. We prove that correct organization of
F-actin cytoskeleton due to the mechanical properties of the microenvironment is 
necessary for BMP-induced smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.
These results suggest that stem cell differentiation is dictated mechanically,
but in the presence of a biochemical factor, the effect of the mechanical factor 
on stem cell commitment is modified. This can explain the diversity of stem cell 
behaviors in vivo where different growth factors are sequestrated on the ECM.

Natural glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and chemically modified GAG derivatives are
known to support osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).
This effect has mainly been described to be mediated by increasing the
effectiveness of bone anabolic growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs) due to the binding and presentation of the growth factor or by modulating 
its signal transduction pathway. In the present study, the influence of
chondroitin sulfate (CS) and two chemically over-sulfated CS derivatives on
osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) and on BMP-2
and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) signalling was investigated.
Over-sulfated CS derivatives induced an increase of tissue non-specific alkaline 
phosphatase (TNAP) activity and calcium deposition, whereas collagen synthesis
was slightly decreased. The BMP-2-induced Smad1/5 activation was inhibited in the
presence of over-sulfated CS derivatives leading to a loss of BMP-2-induced TNAP 
activity and calcium deposition. In contrast, the TGF-β1-induced activation of
Smad2/3 and collagen synthesis were not affected by the over-sulfated CS
derivatives. BMP-2 and TGF-β1 did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 or mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 in hMSC. These data suggest
that over-sulfated CS derivatives themselves are able to induce osteogenic
differentiation, probably independent of BMP-2 and TGF-β1 signalling, and offer
therefore an interesting approach for the improvement of bone healing.

Wnt5a signaling is a substantial constituent in bone morphogenetic
protein-2-mediated osteoblastogenesis.

Wnts are secreted glycoproteins that mediate developmental and post-developmental
physiology by regulating cellular processes including proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis through β-catenin-dependent canonical and
β-catenin-independent noncanonical pathway. It has been reported that Wnt5a
activates noncanonical Wnt signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan
receptor 2 (Ror2). Although it appears that Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling supports normal 
bone physiology, the biological significance of noncanonical Wnts in osteogenesis
is essentially unknown. In this study, we identified expression of Wnt5a in
osteoblasts in the ossification zone of the tibial growth plate as well as bone
marrow of the rat tibia as assessed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we show
that osteoblastic differentiation mediated by BMP-2 is associated with increased 
expression of Wnt5a and Ror2 using cultured pre-osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells.
Silencing gene expression of Wnt5a and Ror2 in MC3T3-E1 cells results in
suppression of BMP-2-mediated osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that Wnt5a
and Ror2 signaling are of substantial importance for BMP-2-mediated osteoblastic 
differentiation. BMP-2 stimulation induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in a
similar fashion in both siWnt5a-treated cells and control cells, suggesting that 
Wnt5a was dispensable for the phosphorylation of Smads by BMP-2. Taken together, 
our results suggest that Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling appears to be involved in

How the pluripotency of stem cells is maintained and the role of transcription
factors in this maintenance remain major questions. In the present study, in
order to clarify the mechanism underlying the pluripotency of stem cells for the 
advancement of regenerative medicine, we examined the effect of forced Nanog
expression in mesenchymal cells, with a particular focus on osteogenic
differentiation. The human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) or mouse mesenchymal
cell line C3H10T1/2 cells were transduced with the Nanog gene or control green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene by using retrovirus vectors. Short-term, forced
Nanog gene expression had few effects on the terminal osteogenic differentiation 
of either hMSCs or C3H10T1/2 cells. To determine its long-term effects, we
established C3H10T1/2 cells expressing Nanog constitutively. Constitutive Nanog
expression strongly induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. In
regard to cell proliferation, constitutive Nanog expression only repressed the
proliferation of the cells treated with rhBMP-2. Moreover, Nanog also had the
potential to promote the proliferation of C3H10T1/2 cells in the absence of
rhBMP-2. Constitutive Nanog expression enhanced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and 
suppressed Cdk4 and cyclinD1. The promoter activities of both the osteocalcin and
Id-1 genes were activated in cells expressing Nanog constitutively. To identify
downstream molecules of Nanog involved in the promotion of osteogenic
differentiation, we performed a DNA microarray analysis and discovered that
NFATc1 was one of the downstream effectors of Nanog. These results indicate that 
Nanog functions as a modulator of BMP signaling in C3H10T1/2 cells probably
through a genome reprogramming process.

Bone-remodeling imbalance induced by increased bone resorption and osteoclast
formation is known to cause skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. There has
been growing interest in the anabolic natural agents that enhance bone formation.
Silymarin is flavonolignans extracted from blessed milk thistle. Several studies 
suggest that silymarin possesses antihepatotoxic properties and anticancer
effects against carcinoma cells. This study investigated promoting effects of
silymarin on differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 mouse
cells and on bone mineral density (BMD) by in vivo fracture experiments.
Osteoblasts were treated with 1-20 μmol/L silymarin for 15 days in a
differentiating medium. In addition, this study explored signaling pathways
implicated in the osteoblastogenesis of silymarin. It was found that silymarin
stimulated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium nodule formation in a 
dose-dependent manner with a substantial effect on osteoblast proliferation.
Silymarin treatment enhanced collagen secretion, osteocalcin transcription and
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression. The BMP inhibitor noggin suppressed 
the silymarin-promoted ALP activity in differentiated osteoblasts, suggesting
that its osteoblastogenic actions entail the BMP pathway. This was proved by
increased SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and runt-related transcription factor 2
(Runx2) expression in the presence of silymarin. In 21-day fracture-healing
experiments, fractured and silymarin (10 mg/kg)-treated C57BL/6 mice showed
better bone healing than fractured mice. Silymarin supplementation improved
tibial bone strength with elevated BMD and serum levels of osteogenic ALP and
osteocalcin. Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that 
silymarin has a potential to enhance osteoblastogenesis through accelerating
BMP/SMAD/Runx2 signal pathways and to improve fracture healing and bone strength 
in mouse tibiae.

Radix Astragalus has been identified to exert beneficial effects in preventing
postmenopausal bone loss. However, the active ingredients and mechanism of action
remain unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of Astragaloside II (AST
II), which is a monomer of Astragalus saponin, on the viability, proliferation,
differentiation and maturation of rat primary osteoblasts, as well as its
relevant molecular mechanism. We found that AST II exhibits a significant
induction of proliferation, differentiation and mineralization in primary
osteoblasts. AST II stimulates osteoblast differentiation at various stages, from
early to late stage of differentiated osteoblasts. Furthermore, induction of
differentiation by AST II is associated with increased expression of bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), activation of Smad1/5/8, ERK1/2 and p38, and
increased expression of core-binding factor 1 (Cbfa1)/Runx2. BMP antagonist
(Noggin) blocks the effect of AST II on cell differentiation, and Smad1/5/8, p38,
Cbfa1 expression, but only partly decreases ERK1/2 activation. This indicates
that BMP-2 is essential in AST II-mediated osteoblast differentiation and
Smad1/5/8, p38, Cbfa1 activation, and is partly involved in ERK1/2 activation. In
conclusion, although in vivo studies are required in the future, as a
phyto-saponin of Radix Astragalus, AST II may become a novel candidate that is
beneficial for stimulating the osteoblastic activity resulting in bone formation,
which has not been recognized and reported previously.

stem cells.

IL-3 is an important cytokine that regulates hematopoiesis. We have previously
demonstrated that IL-3 is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis and bone
resorption. In the present study, we have investigated the role of IL-3 on human 
osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. We found that IL-3 in a
dose-dependent manner increases osteoblast differentiation and matrix
mineralization in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). IL-3 significantly
enhances the expression of osteoblast specific genes such as alkaline
phosphatase, collagen type-I, osteocalcin and osteopontin; and Runx-2 and osterix
transcription factors. Moreover, IL-3 induces the expression of bone
morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and activates smad1/5/8. IL-3 enhances
osteoblast differentiation and BMP-2 secretion through JAK/STAT pathway.
Interestingly, IL-3 promotes in vivo bone regeneration ability of MSCs. Thus, we 
reveal for the first time that IL-3 enhances human osteoblast differentiation and
bone formation in both in vitro and in vivo conditions, and suggest its
therapeutic potential for bone formation in important bone diseases.

BMP-2 inhibits tumor growth of human renal cell carcinoma and induces bone
formation.

Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming growth factor 
superfamily, has been shown to have inhibitory effect on many tumor types.
However, the effect of BMP-2 on human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still
unknown. We previously showed that BMP-2 inhibits tumorigenicity of cancer stem
cells in human osteosarcoma OS99-1 cells. Our study investigates the effect of
BMP-2 on human RCC using ACHN and Caki-2 cell lines. Three types of BMP receptors
were found to be expressed in ACHN and Caki-2 cells. In vitro, BMP-2 was found to
inhibit the growth of ACHN and Caki-2 cells. The antiproliferative effect seems
to be due to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which was revealed by flow
cytometry analysis. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
analysis, we demonstrated BMP-2 upregulated osteogenic markers Runx-2 and
Collagen Type I gene expression in ACHN and Caki-2 cells. Treatment of ACHN and
Caki-2 cells with BMP-2 induced a rapid phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. In vivo,
all animals receiving low number of ACHN (1 × 10(4)) and Caki-2 (5 × 10(4)) cells
treated with 30 μg of BMP-2 per animal showed limited tumor growth with
significant bone formation, whereas untreated cells developed large tumor masses 
without bone formation in immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. These results suggest that BMP-2 inhibits
growth of RCC as well as causes induction of osseous bone formation. Further
research is needed to determine the relationship between inhibition of cell
proliferation and bone induction.

miRNAs are endogenously expressed 18- to 25-nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene
expression through translational repression by binding to a target mRNA.
Recently, it has been indicated that miRNAs are closely related to osteogenesis. 
Our previous data suggested that miR-30 family members might be important
regulators during the biomineralization process. However, whether and how they
modulate osteogenic differentiation have not been explored. In this study, we
demonstrated that miR-30 family members negatively regulate BMP-2-induced
osteoblast differentiation by targeting Smad1 and Runx2. Evidentially,
overexpression of miR-30 family members led to a decrease of alkaline phosphatase
activity, whereas knockdown of them increased the activity. Then bioinformatic
analysis identified potential target sites of the miR-30 family located in the 3'
untranslated regions of Smad1 and Runx2. Western blot analysis and quantitative
RT-PCR assays demonstrated that miR-30 family members inhibit Smad1 gene
expression on the basis of repressing its translation. Furthermore,
dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that Smad1 is a direct target of miR-30
family members. Rescue experiments that overexpress Smad1 and Runx2 significantly
eliminated the inhibitory effect of miR-30 on osteogenic differentiation and
provided strong evidence that miR-30 mediates the inhibition of osteogenesis by
targeting Smad1 and Runx2. Also, the inhibitory effects of the miR-30 family were
validated in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, our study
uncovered that miR-30 family members are key negative regulators of
BMP-2-mediated osteogenic differentiation.

Wnt3a stimulates Mepe, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, expression
directly by the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and indirectly 
through the stimulation of autocrine Bmp-2 expression.

Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) is a specific marker of
mineralizing osteoblasts and osteocytes. Canonical BMP and Wnt signaling pathways
are two of the strongest paracrine signals stimulating osteogenesis. Our previous
results indicated that Mepe expression is stimulated by the BMP-2-signaling
pathway. The specific aim of this study addressed whether Mepe expression is also
controlled by Wnt signaling, and whether there is a cross-regulation between two 
major osteogenic signaling pathways. Treatment with Wnt3a, a canonical Wnt
signaling stimulator, strongly enhanced Mepe mRNA expression. Knock-down of
β-catenin with siRNA completely reversed Wnt3a-stimulated Mepe expression. The
Mepe mRNA expression level was increased by overexpression of β-catenin and
Lef-1, even in the absence of Wnt3a. Highly conserved Lef-1 response elements
were identified in the mouse Mepe promoter. The direct binding of Lef-1 to these 
elements is critical for Mepe expression, indicating that Mepe is a direct target
of canonical Wnt signaling. Meanwhile, we also found that Wnt3a treatment
strongly stimulated Bmp-2 expression, and that the subsequent increase in Bmp-2
protein was determined in Wnt3a-treated conditioned medium (CM). Treatment of
MC3T3-E1 cells with CM stimulated phosphorylation of the Smad1/5 proteins and
their downstream Dlx5 mRNA expression. The CM-mediated increases of phospho-Smad 
and Dlx5 expression were not blocked completely by a Wnt3a antagonist, Dkk-1, but
were almost completely suppressed by the addition of a Bmp-2 antagonist, Noggin. 
Collectively, Wnt3a stimulates Mepe transcription directly by a canonical Wnt
signaling pathway through β-catenin and Lef-1 and indirectly through the
activation of a Bmp-2 autocrine loop.

Heparin displays several types of biological activities by binding to various
extracellular molecules, including pivotal roles in bone metabolism. We have
previously reported that heparin competitively inhibits the binding activity of
bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) to BMP and the BMP receptor (BMPR) and
suppresses BMP-2 osteogenic activity. In the present study, we examined whether
heparin affects osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP-2 at various time
points in vitro. We found that 72 h of treatment with heparin inhibited alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity. However, 144 h of treatment enhanced the ALP activity
in BMP-2-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells. Although heparin decreased the
phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 after 0.5 h of culture, prolonged periods of culture
with heparin enhanced the Smad phosphorylation. In addition, 72 h of treatment
with heparin enhanced the mRNA expression of runx2 and osterix in
BMP-2-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of BMP
antagonists and inhibitory Smads induced by BMP-2 was preferentially blocked by
heparin at the 24 and 48 h time points. These findings indicate biphasic effects 
of heparin on BMP-2 activity and suggest that heparin has complex effects on the 
BMP-2 osteogenic bioactivities. Prolonged culture with heparin stimulated
BMP-2-induced osteogenic activity via down-regulation of BMP-2 antagonists and
inhibitory Smads.

Despite the involvement of BMP-3b (also called GDF-10) in osteogenesis,
embryogenesis and adipogenesis, the functional receptors and intracellular
signaling of BMP-3b have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we
investigated the cellular mechanism of BMP-3b in osteoblast differentiation using
mouse myoblastic C2C12 cells. BMP-3b stimulated activin/TGF-β-responsive promoter
activities. The stimulatory actions of BMP-3b on activin/TGF-β-responsive
activities were suppressed by co-treatment with BMP-2. BMP-responsive promoter
activities stimulated by BMP-2 were significantly inhibited by treatment with
BMP-3b. BMP-3b suppressed the expression of osteoblastic markers including Runx2,
osteocalcin and type-1 collagen induced by BMP-2, -4, -6 and -7. BMP-2-induced
Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and mRNA levels of the BMP target gene Id-1 were
suppressed by co-treatment with BMP-3b, although BMP-3b failed to activate
Smad1/5/8 signaling. Of interest, the BMP-3b suppression of BMP-2-induced Id-1
expression was not observed in cells overexpressing Smad4 molecules. On the other
hand, BMP-3b directly activated Smad2/3 phosphorylation and activin/TGF-β target 
gene PAI-1 mRNA expression, while BMP-2 suppressed BMP-3b-induced Smad2/3 signal 
activation. BMP-2 inhibition of BMP-3b-induced PAI-1 expression was also reversed
by overexpression of Smad4. Analysis using inhibitors for BMP-Smad1/5/8 pathways 
revealed that these BMP-3b effects were mediated via receptors other than ALK-2, 
-3 and -6. Furthermore, results of inhibitory studies using extracellular domains
for BMP receptor constructs showed that the activity of BMP-3b was functionally
facilitated by a combination of ALK-4 and ActRIIA. Collectively, BMP-3b plays an 
inhibitory role in the process of osteoblast differentiation, in which BMP-3b and
BMP-2 are mutually antagonistic possibly by competing with the availability of
Smad4.

dental follicle precursor cells.

The transcription factor DLX3 plays a decisive role in bone development of
vertebrates. In neural-crest derived stem cells from the dental follicle (DFCs), 
DLX3 is differentially expressed during osteogenic differentiation, while other
osteogenic transcription factors such as DLX5 or RUNX2 are not highly induced.
DLX3 has therefore a decisive role in the differentiation of DFCs, but its actual
biological effects and regulation are unknown. This study investigated the
DLX3-regulated processes in DFCs. After DLX3 overexpression, DFCs acquired a
spindle-like cell shape with reorganized actin filaments. Here, marker genes for 
cell morphology, proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation were
significantly regulated as shown in a microarray analysis. Further experiments
showed that DFCs viability is directly influenced by the expression of DLX3, for 
example, the amount of apoptotic cells was increased after DLX3 silencing. This
transcription factor stimulates the osteogenic differentiation of DFCs and
regulates the BMP/SMAD1-pathway. Interestingly, BMP2 did highly induce DLX3 and
reverse the inhibitory effect of DLX3 silencing in osteogenic differentiation.
However, after DLX3 overexpression in DFCs, a BMP2 supplementation did not
improve the expression of DLX3 and the osteogenic differentiation. In conclusion,
DLX3 influences cell viability and regulates osteogenic differentiation of DFCs
via a BMP2-dependent pathway and a feedback control.

monolayer formation induces cell differentiation.

Bone extracellular matrix consists of a network of proteins in which growth
factors, like bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), are embedded and released
upon matrix turnover and degradation. Recombinant human (rh)BMP-2 shows promise
in enhancing bone fracture repair, although issues regarding finding a suitable
delivery system still limit its extensive clinical use. The aim of this study is 
to determine which cell activities are triggered by the presentation of
immobilized rhBMP-2. For this purpose gold surfaces were first decorated with a
self-assembled monolayer consisting of a hetero-bifunctional linker. rhBMP-2 was 
covalently bound to the surfaces via this linker and used to investigate the
cellular responses of C2C12 myoblasts. We show that covalently immobilized
rhBMP-2 (iBMP-2) initiates short-term signaling events. Using a BMP-responsive
reporter gene assay and western blotting to monitor phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 
we prove that iBMP-2 activates BMP-dependent signal transduction. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that iBMP-2 suppresses myotube formation and promotes the osteoblast 
phenotype in C2C12 cells. The bioactivity of surface-bound rhBMP-2 presented in
this study is not due to its release into the medium. As such, our simple
approach paves the way for the controlled local presentation of immobilized
growth factors, limiting degradation while still maintaining biological activity.

Bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced signaling and osteogenesis is regulated by
cell shape, RhoA/ROCK, and cytoskeletal tension.

Osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is classically
thought to be mediated by different cytokines such as the bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs). Here, we report that cell adhesion to extracellular matrix
(ECM), and its effects on cell shape and cytoskeletal mechanics, regulates
BMP-induced signaling and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Using
micropatterned substrates to progressively restrict cell spreading and flattening
against ECM, we demonstrated that BMP-induced osteogenesis is progressively
antagonized with decreased cell spreading. BMP triggered rapid and sustained
RhoA/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) activity and contractile tension only
in spread cells, and this signaling was required for BMP-induced osteogenesis.
Exploring the molecular basis for this effect, we found that restricting cell
spreading, reducing ROCK signaling, or inhibiting cytoskeletal tension prevented 
BMP-induced SMA/mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD)1 c-terminal
phosphorylation, SMAD1 dimerization with SMAD4, and SMAD1 translocation into the 
nucleus. Together, these findings demonstrate the direct involvement of cell
spreading and RhoA/ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal tension generation in BMP-induced
signaling and early stages of in vitro osteogenesis, and highlight the essential 
interplay between biochemical and mechanical cues in stem cell differentiation.

Osteoblasts are mechanosensitive cells, which respond to biomechanical stimuli to
regulate the bone structure through anabolic and catabolic gene regulation. To
examine the effects of mechanical forces on the osteogenic responses through the 
SMAD signaling in osteoblasts, the cells were cultured in well-characterized
mechanoresponsive 3-D scaffolds and exposed to 10% dynamic compressive strain
(Cmp) at 1 Hz. Subsequently, SMAD phosphorylation and osteogenic gene induction
was examined. Osteoblasts cultured in 3-D scaffolds exhibited increased
constitutive SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation, as compared to monolayers cultures. This
SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation was further upregulated after 10, 30 and 60 min in
response to Cmp, exhibiting a peak activation at 30 min. No significant changes
in SMAD2 phosphorylation were observed, suggesting signals generated by Cmp may
not activate the Transforming Growth Factor-β signaling cascade. Subsequently,
biomechanical stimulation-induced SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation upregulated the
expression of osteogenic genes such as Osteoprotegrin, Msx2 and Runx2.
Dorsomorphin, a selective inhibitor of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
receptor type 1 (BMPR1), blocked Cmp-induced SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation, as well 
as Osteoprotegrin, Msx2 and Runx2 gene expression. Collectively, the present
findings demonstrate that biomechanical stimulation of osteoblasts activates SMAD
1/5/8 in the BMP signaling pathway through BMPR1 and may enhance osteogenesis by 
upregulating SMAD-dependent osteogenic genes.

adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is regulated by extracellular
signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation of Smad1. Adenoviral constructs carrying 
either unmodified human Smad1 or Smad1 mutated in the linker region to preclude
extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation were expressed in human and
rodent cells. Unlike unmodified Smad1, expression of mutated Smad1 facilitated
BMP-stimulated expression of osteoblast markers in human MSC but had no effect on
either rat MSC or mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Expression of mutated
Smad1 in adult human MSC cultures also resulted in increased nuclear accumulation
of BMP-activated Smads and elevated gene transcripts characteristic of
differentiating osteoblasts. These results may partly explain the poor efficacy
of BMP in some human bone therapies and indicate an important mechanism
regulating BMP-mediated bone formation in adults.

Proteasome inhibitors enhance bone formation and osteoblastic differentiation in 
vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we examined whether the molecular
mechanisms of lactacystin, one of many proteasome inhibitors, stimulated the
osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 cells that is induced by bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs). Pretreatment with lactacystin enhanced the alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) activity induced by BMP2, BMP4 or BMP7, but lactacystin did not induce ALP 
in the absence of BMPs. In addition, lactacystin-stimulated BMP2 induced mRNA
expression of ALP, type I collagen, osteonectin, osteocalcin, Id1, Osterix, and
Runx2. Lactacystin maintained BMP2-induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and
increased the length of time that these Smads were bound to target DNA. Moreover,
lactacystin prevented BMP receptor-induced Smad degradation. This enhancement of 
BMP2-induced ALP activity and Smad phosphorylation by lactacystin was also
observed in primary osteoblasts. These findings suggest that pretreatment with
lactacystin accelerates BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation by increasing
the levels of phosphorylated Smads, which are maintained because BMP
receptor-induced degradation is inhibited. We propose that optimized stimulation 
by proteasome inhibitors in a clinical setting may facilitate autogenous or
BMP-induced bone formation in areas of defective bone.

acid.

and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kyushu Dental College, Kitakyushu 803-8580, Japan.

OBJECTIVES: Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is expected to be utilized to
fill bone defects and promote healing of fractures. However, it is unable to
generate an adequate clinical response for use in bone regeneration. Recently, it
was reported that glycosaminoglycans, including heparin, heparan sulfate, keratan
sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and
hyaluronic acid (HA), regulate BMP-2 activity, though the mechanism by which HA
regulates osteogenic activities has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this
study was to investigate the effects of HA on osteoblast differentiation induced 
by BMP-2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monolayer cultures of osteoblastic lineage MG63 cells were
incubated with BMP-2 and HA for various time periods. To determine osteoblastic
differentiation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the cell lysates was
quantified. Phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8, p38, and ERK proteins was determined
by Western blot analysis. To elucidate the nuclear translocation of
phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8, stimulated cells were subjected to immunofluorescence 
microscopy. To further elucidate the role of HA in enhancement of BMP-2-induced
Smad signaling, mRNA expressions of the BMP-2 receptor antagonists noggin and
follistatin were detected using real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: BMP-2-induced ALP activation, Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation, and nuclear
translocation were up-regulated when MG63 cells were cultured with both BMP-2 and
HA. Western blot analysis revealed that phosphorylation of ERK protein was
diminished by HA. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of noggin and follistatin
induced by BMP-2 were preferentially blocked by HA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HA enhanced BMP-2 induces osteoblastic
differentiation in MG63 cells via down-regulation of BMP-2 antagonists and ERK
phosphorylation.

Recently we have reported that biglycan (BGN) promotes osteoblast differentiation
and that this function is due in part to its ability to positively modulate bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP) functions. In this study we investigated the role of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of BGN in this function using in vitro and in vivo
models. C2C12 myogenic cells were treated or untreated with BMP-2 alone or in
combination with glycanated, partially glycanated or de-glycanated BGN, and the
effects on BMP signaling and function were assessed by Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation 
and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Furthermore, the effect of
de-glycanation of BGN on BMP-2 induced osteogenesis was investigated employing a 
rat mandible defect model. The defects were filled with collagen scaffolds loaded
with glycanated or de-glycanated BGN alone or in combination with a sub-optimal
dose of BMP-2 (subBMP). In in vitro experiments, BMP signaling and function were 
the greatest when BMP-2 was combined with de-glycanated BGN among the groups
tested. In the rat mandible experiments, μCT analyses revealed that the newly
formed bone was significantly increased only when subBMP was combined with
de-glycanated BGN. The data indicate that the GAG component of BGN functions as a
suppressor for the BGN-assisted BMP function.

California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1679, USA.

RATIONALE: Diabetes mellitus is frequently complicated by cardiovascular disease,
such as vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction, which have been
associated with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hyperglycemia in vitro and diabetes in vivo
promote vascular BMP activity and correlate with vascular calcification.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Increased glucose augmented expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4;
the BMP inhibitors matrix Gla protein (MGP) and Noggin; activin-like kinase
receptor (ALK)1, -2, -3 and -6; the BMP type 2 receptor; and the vascular
endothelial growth factor in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Diabetes
induced expression of the same factors in the aortic wall of 3 animal models of
diabetes, Ins2(Akita/+) mice, db/db mice, and HIP rats (rats transgenic for human
islet amyloid polypeptide), representative of types 1 and 2 diabetes. Conditioned
media from glucose-treated HAECs increased angiogenesis in bovine aortic
endothelial cells, as mediated by BMP-4, and osteogenesis in calcifying vascular 
cells, as mediated by BMP-2. BMP-4, MGP, ALK1, and ALK2 were predominantly
expressed on the endothelial side of the aorta, and small interfering RNA
experiments showed that these genes were regulated as a group. Diabetic mice and 
rats showed a dramatic increase in aortic BMP activity, as demonstrated by
SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. This was associated with increased osteogenesis and
calcium accumulation. These changes were prevented in the Ins2(Akita/+) mice by
breeding them with MGP transgenic mice, which increased aortic BMP inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia and diabetes activate vascular BMP activity, which is 
instrumental in promoting vascular calcification and may be limited by increasing
BMP inhibition.

8-Prenylkaempferol accelerates osteoblast maturation through bone morphogenetic
protein-2/p38 pathway to activate Runx2 transcription.

AIMS: In this study, we investigated the effect of 8-prenylkaempferol (8-PK), a
prenyl-flavonoid isolated from Sophora flavescens, on osteoblast differentiation 
and maturation.
MAIN METHODS: MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 8-PK and the cytotoxicity was
assayed. Osteoblast differentiation and maturation were evaluated by analyzing
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and cell mineralization, respectively. RT-PCR
and Western blot were executed to determine the effects of 8-PK on osteoblast
differentiation-related gene expression and signaling pathway.
KEY FINDINGS: 8-PK significantly promoted ALP activity, up-regulated mRNA
expressions of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and type I collagen, and induced bone
nodules formation. Induction of differentiation by 8-PK was associated with
increased bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 expression, and sequentially
up-regulated the phosphorylations of Smad1/5/8 and p38, and increased the nuclear
translocation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Addition of BMP-2
antagonist noggin blocked 8-PK and recombinant mouse BMP-2-induced ALP activity, 
reconfirming that BMP-2 production is required in 8-PK-mediated osteoblast
differentiation. Noggin also abrogated 8-PK evoked phosphorylations of Smad1/5/8 
and p38, suggesting that BMP-2 signaling is required for p38 activation in
8-PK-treated cells. Application of p38 inhibitor SB203580 repressed not only
8-PK-mediated activation of ALP, but also the nuclear translocation of Runx2 and 
bone nodules formation.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present results suggested that BMP-2/p38/Runx2 pathways were
involved in 8-PK-induced differentiation/maturation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and
firstly demonstrated that 8-PK might be a promising agent for inducing
osteogenesis.

Adipose-derived stem cells and BMP2: part 2. BMP2 may not influence the
osteogenic fate of human adipose-derived stem cells.

California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1749, USA. pzuk@mednet.ucla.edu

Although recent studies have proposed that human adipose-derived stem cells
(ASCs), together with BMP2, can heal critical-sized bony defects, a companion
study in this issue suggests that ASCs may not respond to BMP2 in vivo. To
examine why this may be occurring. ASCs were treated with BMP2 and the cells' in 
vitro osteogenic capacity assessed along with the canonical BMP2 signaling
pathway. In vitro treatment of ASCs with BMP2 had no consistent and significant
effect on matrix mineralization or their expression of several osteogenic
markers. Consistent and significant changes to Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation levels
were also not observed upon BMP2 induction. The removal of dexamethasone from the
BMP2 induction conditions had no effect on the observed results nor did
stimulating ASCs with BMP2 from an alternate source (INFUSE; Medtronic,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). In addition, no BMP-induced nuclear translocation of
Smad1/Smad4 complexes could be discerned, suggesting that the canonical BMP2
signaling pathway may not be functional in ASCs. Interestingly, three downstream 
BMP2 pathway genes, distal-less3 (dlx3), distal-less5 (dlx5), and osterix, were
not expressed in BMP2-induced ASCs, calling the utility of BMP2 induced in ASCs
into question. The results of this in vitro study were consistent with that of
our companion in vivo study that suggests a lack of effect of BMP2 on the
osteogenic capacity of ASCs. Taken together, the data from both studies suggest
that ASC osteogenic differentiation may not be influenced by BMP2. Consequently, 
combining BMP2 treatment with adult stem cells, like ASCs, may not be a viable
strategy for bony healing.

MC3T3-E1 cells.

BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that low-intensity laser irradiation
accelerated bone formation, and that this mechanism deeply involved insulin-like 
growth factor I expression. However, as bone formation is supported by many local
factors, the mechanism involved in laser irradiation remains incompletely
understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 
laser irradiation on the osteogenic response in vitro.
METHODS: Mouse osteoblast-like cells, MC3T3-E1, were cultured and were irradiated
for 5-20 minutes (0.96-3.82 J/cm(2)) at the subconfluent stage using a
low-intensity Ga-Al-As diode laser apparatus. After laser irradiation, expression
of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), transcription factors (Runx2, Osterix,
Dlx5, Msx2), and phosphorylation of Smad1 were determined, and calcium content of
cell cultures was also determined.
RESULTS: Irradiation at 1.91 J/cm(2) significantly increased the expression of
BMPs and Runx2, Osterix, Dlx5, Msx2, and the phosphorylation of Smad1. Noggin, a 
BMP receptor blocker, inhibited the laser-induced Runx2 expression and
phosphorylation of Smad1. Moreover, laser irradiation significantly increased the
calcium content of cell cultures, and noggin inhibited this increase.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that low-intensity laser irradiation stimulates
in vitro mineralization via increased expression of BMPs and transcription
factors associated with osteoblast differentiation.

Imbalanced functions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts are involved in
inflammatory bone damage. The clinical effectiveness of blocking TNF-alpha in
treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis established the significance of
TNF-alpha in the pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the cellular
mechanism by which estrogen and glucocorticoid interact in osteoblastic
differentiation regulated by BMP and TNF-alpha using mouse myoblastic C2C12
cells. The expression of estrogen receptors, (ER)alpha and ERbeta, and
glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) was significantly increased by BMP-2 treatment
regardless of the presence of estradiol and dexamethasone. Estradiol, but not
dexamethasone, enhanced BMP-induced Runx2 and osteocalcin expression in C2C12
cells. In addition, TNF-alpha suppressed BMP-2-induced Runx2 and osteocalcin
expression, and estradiol and dexamethasone reversed the TNF-alpha effects on
BMP-2-induced Runx2 expression. Dexamethasone also abolished osteocalcin
expression induced by BMP-2. Interestingly, BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8
phosphorylation and Id-1 promoter activity were enhanced by estradiol
pretreatment. On the other hand, dexamethasone suppressed BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8
activation. TNF-alpha-induced SAPK/JNK activity was suppressed by estradiol,
while NFkappaB phosphorylation was inhibited by dexamethasone. Of note, the
inhibitory effects of TNF- on BMP-2-induced Runx2 and osteocalcin expression were
reversed by SAPK/JNK inhibition regardless of the presence of estradiol. The
estradiol effects that enhance BMP-2-induced Runx2 and osteocalcin mRNA
expression were restored by antagonizing ER, and moreover, membrane-impermeable
estradiol-BSA failed to enhance the BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation.
Thus, estrogen and glucocorticoid are functionally involved in the process of
osteoblast differentiation regulated by BMPs and TNF-alpha. BMP-2 increases the
sensitivities of ERs and GCR, whereas estrogen and glucocorticoid differentially 
regulate BMP-Smad and TNF-alpha signaling.

Efficient osteogenic differentiation and bone formation from mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) should have clinical applications in treating nonunion fracture
healing. MSCs are adherent bone marrow stromal cells that can self-renew and
differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages.
We have identified bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP-9) as one of the most
osteogenic BMPs. Here we investigate the effect of insulin-like growth factor 2
(IGF-2) on BMP-9-induced bone formation. We have found that endogenous IGF-2
expression is low in MSCs. Expression of IGF-2 can potentiate BMP-9-induced early
osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of later
markers. IGF-2 has been shown to augment BMP-9-induced ectopic bone formation in 
the stem cell implantation assay. In perinatal limb explant culture assay, IGF-2 
enhances BMP-9-induced endochondral ossification, whereas IGF-2 itself can
promote the expansion of the hypertropic chondrocyte zone of the cultured limb
explants. Expression of the IGF antagonists IGFBP3 and IGFBP4 leads to inhibition
of the IGF-2 effect on BMP-9-induced ALP activity and matrix mineralization.
Mechanistically, IGF-2 is further shown to enhance the BMP-9-induced BMPR-Smad
reporter activity and Smad1/5/8 nuclear translocation. PI3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibitor LY294002 abolishes the IGF-2 potentiation effect on BMP-9-mediated
osteogenic signaling and can directly inhibit BMP-9 activity. These results
demonstrate that BMP-9 crosstalks with IGF-2 through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Taken together, our findings suggest
that a combination of BMP-9 and IGF-2 may be explored as an effective
bone-regeneration agent to treat large segmental bony defects, nonunion fracture,
and/or osteoporotic fracture.

Human dental follicle cells (DFCs) are progenitor cells. Recent studies supposed 
that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs is controlled by growth factors such as
BMP2 and IGF2, but their influence on the differentiation of DFCs has not been
investigated in detail. We examined DFCs after the induction of osteogenic
differentiation with BMP2, IGF2 and a standard osteogenic differentiation medium 
(ODM) with dexamethasone. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the calcium
accumulation demonstrated osteogenic differentiation after all treatments, but
with the most effective differentiation by ODM. Interestingly, markers of the
process of osteoblast differentiation were much higher up-regulated in BMP2- or
IGF2-treated cells than in ODM-treated cells. To evaluate the reason of these
differences, we compared genome-wide expression profiles at an early stage of
differentiation. Chondroblast markers in BMP2-differentiated cells and general
markers for cell differentiation/proliferation in IGF2-treated cells were
significantly regulated. However, ODM-treated DFCs expressed late markers of
osteogenic-differentiated DFCs such as the transcription factor ZBTB16 that is
not expressed in BMP2- or IGF2-differentiated cells. Importantly, although the
BMP-antagonist noggin (NOG) diminishes the phosphorylation of SMAD1 in DFCs, it
did not inhibit osteogenic differentiation by ODM and the expression of ZBTB16.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that osteogenic differentiation of DFCs
can be stimulated with all tested inducers but also independently of BMP
signaling. To evaluate this mechanism, the transcription factor ZBTB16 is a
target for further investigations.

Several studies have shown that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can influence 
adipogenic and osteogenic cell lineages. We have shown that a peptide derived
from BMP-9 (pBMP-9) at 400 ng/ml inhibits the proliferation of preosteoblasts and
induces differentiation. We have now determined the effects of pBMP-9 (400 ng/ml)
and equimolar concentrations of BMP-2 (100 ng/ml), BMP-9 (84.6 ng/ml) and pBMP-9 
(9.04 ng/ml) on human white preadipocytes (HWP). pBMP-9 dose dependently reduced 
the proliferation of HWP without affecting the number of apoptotic cells.
Incubation of the cells for 1 h with BMP-2, BMP-9 or pBMP-9 activated the
Smad1/5/8 pathway, while incubation for 7 days in adipocyte differentiation (AD) 
serum-free medium containing ciglitazone and equimolar concentrations of BMP-2,
BMP-9 or pBMP-9 enhanced the levels of mRNA of the adipogenic markers aP2 and
adipoQ and increased the number of lipid vesicles. Thus, pBMP-9, like BMP-9, can 
increase the AD of HWP in AD serum-free medium.

Osteogenesis associated with persistent inflammation or infection exists in a
broad range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic bone
fracture. The poor outcomes of these conditions will benefit from more effective 
treatments. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms and tested NEMO-binding
domain peptide as a new approach of circumventing TNF-alpha inhibition of
osteoblast differentiation. Our results showed: TNF-alpha markedly decreased
BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity in the multipotent myoblast C2C12
cells in a dose dependent manner; stepwise experiments demonstrated that
BMP-2-induced Smad1 activity was abrogated by addition of exogenous TNF-alpha or 
overexpression of NF-kappaB, and it was significantly elevated by overexpression 
of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB; Western blotting showed that
TNF-alpha markedly decreased the amount of phospho-Smad1 in BMP-2-activated C2C12
cells, but it did not alter Smad1 mRNA abundance as measured by real-time PCR;
addition of a functional cell-permeable NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide
antagonized NF-kappaB activity and ameliorated TNF-alpha inhibition of osteoblast
differentiation. Taken together, our study reveals for the first time that
NF-kappaB activation inhibits osteoblast differentiation by attenuating Smad1
activity and application of NBD peptide ameliorates this inhibitory effect. This 
could lead to new therapeutic drugs that circumvent the inflammatory inhibition
of osteogenesis for treatment of traumatic open fractures with infection,
rheumatoid arthritis and other bone loss disorders.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare disabling disease
characterized by heterotopic ossification for which there is currently no
treatment available. FOP has been linked recently to a heterozygous R206H
mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor activin
receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2). Expression of the mutant ALK2-R206H receptor
(FOP-ALK2) results in increased phosphorylation of the downstream Smad1 effector 
proteins and elevated basal BMP-dependent transcriptional reporter activity,
indicating that FOP-ALK2 is constitutively active. FOP-ALK2-induced
transcriptional activity could be blocked by overexpressing either of the
inhibitory Smads, Smad6 or -7, or by treatment with the pharmacological BMP type 
I receptor inhibitor dorsomorphin. However, in contrast to wild-type ALK2,
FOP-ALK2 is not inhibited by the negative regulator FKBP12. Mesenchymal cells
expressing the FOP-ALK2 receptor are more sensitive to undergoing BMP-induced
osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. In vivo bone formation was
assessed by loading human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) expressing the
ALK2-R206H receptor onto calcium phosphate scaffolds and implantation in nude
mice. Compared with control cells FOP-ALK2-expressing cells induced increased
bone formation. Taken together, the R206H mutation in ALK2 confers constitutive
activity to the mutant receptor, sensitizes mesenchymal cells to BMP-induced
osteoblast differentiation, and stimulates new bone formation. We have generated 
an animal model that can be used as a stepping stone for preclinical studies
aimed at inhibiting the heterotopic ossification characteristic of FOP.

The periodontal ligament (PDL), a connective tissue located between the cementum 
of teeth and the alveolar bone of mandibula, plays a crucial role in the
maintenance and regeneration of periodontal tissues. The PDL contains
fibroblastic cells of a heterogeneous cell population, from which we have
established several cell lines previously. To analyze characteristics unique for 
PDL at a molecular level, we performed cDNA microarray analysis of the PDL cells 
versus MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. The analysis followed by validation by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunochemical staining
revealed that endoglin, which had been shown to associate with transforming
growth factor (TGF)-beta and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as signaling
modulators, was abundantly expressed in PDL cells but absent in osteoblastic
cells. The knockdown of endoglin greatly suppressed the BMP-2-induced
osteoblastic differentiation of PDL cells and subsequent mineralization.
Interestingly, the endoglin knockdown did not alter the level of Smad-1/5/8
phosphorylation induced by BMP-2, while it suppressed the BMP-2-induced
expression of Id1, a representative BMP-responsive gene. Therefore, it is
conceivable that endoglin regulates the expression of BMP-2-responsive genes in
PDL cells at some site downstream of Smad-1/5/8 phosphorylation. Alternatively,
we found that Smad-2 as well as Smad-1/5/8 was phosphorylated by BMP-2 in the PDL
cells, and that the BMP-2-induced Smad-2 phosphorylation was suppressed by the
endoglin knockdown. These results, taken together, raise a possibility that PDL
cells respond to BMP-2 via a unique signaling pathway dependent on endoglin,
which is involved in the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of the
cells.

osteoblasts by DNA-binding-independent actions of the ERalpha.

Estrogens diminish oxidative stress in bone and bone marrow, attenuate the
generation of osteoblasts, and decrease the prevalence of mature osteoblast
apoptosis. We have searched for the molecular mechanism of these effects using as
tools a mouse model bearing an estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) knock-in
mutation that prevents binding to DNA (ERalpha(NERKI/-)) and several osteoblast
progenitor cell models expressing the wild-type ERalpha or the ERalpha(NERKI/-). 
We report that the ability of estrogens to diminish the generation of reactive
oxygen species, stimulate the activity of glutathione reductase, and decrease the
phosphorylation of p66(shc), as well as osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast number 
and apoptosis, were fully preserved in ERalpha(NERKI/-) mice, indicating that the
DNA-binding function of the ERalpha is dispensable for all these effects.
Consistent with the attenuation of osteoblastogenesis in this animal model,
17beta-estradiol attenuated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-induced gene
transcription and osteoblast commitment and differentiation in murine and human
osteoblastic cell lines. Moreover, 17beta-estradiol attenuated BMP-2-induced
differentiation of primary cultures of calvaria- or bone marrow-derived
osteoblastic cells from ERalpha(NERKI/-) mice as effectively as in cells from
wild-type littermates. The inhibitory effect of the hormone on BMP-2 signaling
resulted from an ERalpha-mediated activation of ERKs and the phosphorylation of
Smad1 at the linker region of the protein, which leads to proteasomal
degradation. These results illustrate that the effects of estrogens on oxidative 
stress and the birth and death of osteoblasts do not require the binding of
ERalpha to DNA response elements, but instead they result from the activation of 
cytoplasmic kinases.

Studies revealed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is important in the regulation of
human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal and differentiation. However, its
action on osteogenic differentiation of hESCs is poorly understood. We tested the
effects of pharmacological PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors on their potential to induce 
osteogenic differentiation of hESCs. Under feeder-free culture conditions,
rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) potently inhibited the activities of mTOR and
p70S6K in undifferentiated hESCs; however, LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) and an AKT
inhibitor had no effects. Treatment with any of these inhibitors down-regulated
the hESC markers Oct4 and Nanog, but only rapamycin induced the up-regulation of 
the early osteogenic markers BMP2 and Runx2. We also observed that hESCs
differentiated when treated with FK506, a structural analog of rapamycin, but did
not exhibit an osteogenic phenotype. Increases in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and
Id1-4 mRNA expression indicated that rapamycin significantly stimulated BMP/Smad 
signaling. After inducing both hESCs and human embryoid bodies (hEBs) for 2-3
weeks with rapamycin, osteoblastic differentiation was further characterized by
the expression of osteoblastic marker mRNAs and/or proteins (osterix,
osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, osteonectin, and bone sialoprotein), alkaline
phosphatase activity, and alizarin red S staining for mineralized bone nodule
formation. No significant differences in the osteogenic phenotypes of
rapamycin-differentiated hESCs and hEBs were detected. Our results suggest that, 
among these 3 inhibitors, only rapamycin functions as a potent stimulator of
osteoblastic differentiation of hESCs, and it does so by modulating
rapamycin-sensitive mTOR and BMP/Smad signaling.

mice through increased BMP signaling.

The uncoupling of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity is central to disorders 
such as osteoporosis, osteolytic malignancies, and periodontitis. Numerous
studies have shown explicit functions for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in
skeletogenesis. Their signaling activity has been shown in various contexts to be
regulated by extracellular proteins, including Twisted gastrulation (TWSG1).
However, experimental paradigms determining the effects of BMP regulators on bone
remodeling are limited. In this study, we assessed the role of TWSG1 in postnatal
bone homeostasis. Twsg1-deficient (Twsg1(-/-)) mice developed osteopenia that
could not be explained by defective osteoblast function, because mineral
apposition rate and differentiation markers were not significantly different
compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Instead, we discovered a striking enhancement
of osteoclastogenesis in Twsg1(-/-) mice, leading to increased bone resorption
with resultant osteopenia. Enhanced osteoclastogenesis in Twsg1(-/-) mice was
caused by increased cell fusion, differentiation, and function of osteoclasts.
Furthermore, RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8
levels were enhanced when WT osteoclasts were treated with recombinant BMP2,
suggesting direct regulation of osteoclast differentiation by BMPs. Increase in
detectable levels of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 was noted in osteoclasts from
Twsg1(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the enhanced
osteoclastogenesis in Twsg1(-/-) mice was reversed in vitro in a dose-dependent
manner with exposure to Noggin, a BMP antagonist, strongly suggesting that the
enhanced osteoclastogenesis in Twsg1 mutants is attributable to increased BMP
signaling. Thus, we present a novel and previously uncharacterized role for TWSG1
in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through regulation of BMP activity.

Daily low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulates production of bone morphogenetic
protein in ROS 17/2.8 cells.

Although daily low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can accelerate osteogenic 
differentiation of the rat clonal cell line ROS 17/2.8, the molecular mechanism
that underlies this phenomenon is unclear. The purpose of this study was to
determine which molecules exposed to daily LIPUS treatment stimulate osteogenic
differentiation. The cells were cultured in the presence and absence (control) of
LIPUS stimulation. LIPUS treatments consisted of 1.5-MHz ultrasound administered 
at an intensity of 30 mW/cm(2), 20 min daily for 7 days. The expression of bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors involved in osteogenesis were
measured using real-time PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of the
mothers against decapentaplegic 1 (Smad1) protein was determined by Western
blotting. Daily LIPUS treatment significantly increased the expression of BMP-2, 
-4, and -7 and their receptors, and also phosphorylation of Smad1. Noggin
markedly inhibited the daily LIPUS-induced phosphorylation of Smad1. Our findings
demonstrate that the osteogenic activity of daily LIPUS may be mediated by BMPs
in ROS 17/2.8 cells.

N-methyl pyrrolidone as a potent bone morphogenetic protein enhancer for bone
tissue regeneration.

In medicine, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) has a long track record as a constituent 
in medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration and thus can be
considered as a safe and biologically inactive small chemical. In the present
study, we report on the newly discovered pharmaceutical property of NMP in
enhancing bone regeneration in a rabbit calvarial defect model in vivo. At the
cellular level, the pharmaceutical effect of NMP was confirmed, in particular, in
combination with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, because NMP increased early 
and late markers for maturation of preosteoblasts and human bone marrow-derived
stem cells in vitro. When we used the multipotent cell line C2C12 without
autologous BMP expression, NMP alone had no effect on alkaline phosphatase
activity, a marker for osteogenic transdifferentiation. Nevertheless, in
combination with low BMP-2 doses, alkaline phosphatase activity was more than
eight times as great. Thus, the pharmaceutical NMP mode of action is that of an
enhancer of BMP activity. The dependency of the effects of NMP on BMP was
confirmed in preosteoblasts because noggin, an extracellular BMP inhibitor,
suppressed NMP-induced increases in early markers for osteoblast maturation in
vitro. At the molecular level, NMP was shown to have no effect on the binding of 
BMP-2 to the ectodomain of the high-affinity BMP receptor IA. However, NMP
further increased the phosphorylation of p38 and Smad1,5,8 induced by BMP-2.
Thus, the small chemical NMP enhances BMP activity by increasing the kinase
activity of the BMP receptor complex for Smad1,5,8 and p38 and could be employed 
as a potent drug for bone tissue regeneration and engineering.

angiogenesis and osteoblast differentiation.

Angiogenesis and bone formation are tightly coupled during the formation of the
skeleton. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is required for both bone
development and angiogenesis. We recently identified endosome-associated
FYVE-domain protein (endofin) as a Smad anchor for BMP receptor activation.
Endofin contains a protein-phosphatase pp1c binding domain, which negatively
modulates BMP signals through dephosphorylation of the BMP type I receptor. A
single point mutation of endofin (F872A) disrupts interaction between the
catalytic subunit pp1c and sensitizes BMP signaling in vitro. To study the
functional impact of this mutation in vivo, we targeted expression of an endofin 
(F872A) transgene to osteoblasts. Mice expressing this mutant transgene had
increased levels of phosphorylated Smad1 in osteoblasts and showed increased bone
formation. Trabecular bone volume was significantly increased in the transgenic
mice compared with the wildtype littermates with corresponding increases in
trabecular bone thickness and number. Interestingly, the transgenic mice also had
a pronounced increase in the density of the bone vasculature measured using
contrast-enhanced microCT imaging of Microfil-perfused bones. The vessel surface 
and volume were both increased in association with elevated levels of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in osteoblasts. Endothelial sprouting from the
endofin (F872A) mutant embryonic metatarsals cultured ex vivo was increased
compared with controls and was abolished by an addition of a VEGF neutralizing
antibody. In conclusion, osteoblast targeted expression of a mutant endofin
protein lacking the pp1c binding activity results in sustained signaling of the
BMP type I receptor, which increases bone formation and skeletal angiogenesis.

morphogenetic protein-2 produced by Escherichia coli and dimerized by biochemical
processing.

One problem associated with clinical application of CHO-derived recombinant human
bone morphogenetic protein (C-BMP-2) is its high cost due to the need for use of 
high doses. To solve this problem, Escherichia coli-derived BMP-2 (E-BMP-2) has
been examined using the technique of molecular unfolding and refolding. However, 
it is unclear whether the characteristics of E-BMP-2 are appropriate for clinical
application. In this study, we examined the biological activity of E-BMP-2 and
its heat tolerance in in vitro and in vivo systems. SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed the high purity of E-BMP-2. E-BMP-2-induced 
alkaline phosphatase expression in osteoprogenitor cells (C2C12, ST2, and primary
murine calvarial osteoblast cells) was dose-dependent, and consistently elicited 
ectopic new ossicles of significant size in mice, also in dose-dependent fashion.
In addition, E-BMP-2 induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and mRNA expression of 
osteoblastic differentiation markers to the same extent as C-BMP-2. On the other 
hand, when E-BMP-2 was exposed to increasing heat over time, its bone-inducing
capacity was maintained until reaching 70 degrees C for 2 h or 90 degrees C for
15 min. Thus, E-BMP-2 will exhibit a decrease in activity with the sterilization 
procedures required prior to use in surgery. These findings indicate that the
biological capacity and heat stability of E-BMP-2 are almost equivalent to those 
of currently available C-BMP-2, and suggest that E-BMP-2 might, thus, solve
current problems of cost impeding routine clinical use of rhBMP-2.

BMP canonical Smad signaling through Smad1 and Smad5 is required for endochondral
bone formation.

Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is required for endochondral bone
formation. However, whether or not the effects of BMPs are mediated via canonical
Smad pathways or through noncanonical pathways is unknown. In this study we have 
determined the role of receptor Smads 1, 5 and 8 in chondrogenesis. Deletion of
individual Smads results in viable and fertile mice. Combined loss of Smads 1, 5 
and 8, however, results in severe chondrodysplasia. Smad1/5(CKO)
(cartilage-specific knockout) mutant mice are nearly identical to
Smad1/5(CKO);Smad8(-/-) mutants, indicating that Smads 1 and 5 have overlapping
functions and are more important than Smad8 in cartilage. The Smad1/5(CKO)
phenotype is more severe than that of Smad4(CKO) mice, challenging the dogma, at 
least in chondrocytes, that Smad4 is required to mediate Smad signaling through
BMP pathways. The chondrodysplasia in Smad1/5(CKO) mice is accompanied by
imbalances in cross-talk between the BMP, FGF and Ihh/PTHrP pathways. We show
that Ihh is a direct target of BMP pathways in chondrocytes, and that FGF exerts 
antagonistic effects on Ihh expression. Finally, we tested whether FGF exerts its
antagonistic effects directly through Smad linker phosphorylation. The results
support the alternative conclusion that the effects of FGFs on BMP signaling are 
indirect in vivo.

The in vitro osteogenetic characteristics of primary osteoblastic cells from a
rabbit calvarium.

Previously, we showed that recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2
(rhBMP-2) increased bone augmentation beyond the skeletal envelope within a
titanium cap in a rabbit calvarium; many cuboidal osteoblastic cells were
observed histologically. These results suggested that the new osteoblastic cells 
might have differentiated and matured via stimulation by rhBMP-2. To date,
however, no studies have reported the characteristics of osteoblastic cells
derived from adult rabbit calvarium, after addition of rhBMP-2. To determine the 
effects of rhBMP-2 on osteoblastic cells, we observed morphological
characteristics and alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblastic cells from an
adult rabbit calvarium. The expression of proteins in the BMP signaling pathway
and extracellular matrix were analyzed, and mineralized nodule formation was
assessed. The alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly after rhBMP-2
stimulation. The protein levels of phosphorylated-Smad1, Runx2, osteocalcin,
osteopontin, and type I collagen were augmented by rhBMP-2 stimulation using
Western blotting or ELISA; rhBMP-2 also stimulated mineralized nodule formation
with alizarin red staining. The results suggest that primary osteoblastic cells
derived from a rabbit calvarium have osteogenetic characteristics in vitro,
underscoring the potential use of these cells as a model for studying bone
formation. These cells may play an important role in in vivo bone augmentation in
a rabbit experimental model.

Protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC) inhibits osteoblastic differentiation 
and its suppression promotes osteogenesis in vitro.

Protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC) is a secreted protein characterized by
a cysteine knot structure, which binds bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and
thereby inhibits their binding to BMP receptors. As an extracellular BMP
antagonist, PRDC may play critical roles in osteogenesis; however, its expression
and function in osteoblastic differentiation have not been determined. Here, we
investigated whether PRDC is expressed in osteoblasts and whether it regulates
osteogenesis in vitro. PRDC mRNA was found to be expressed in the pre-osteoblasts
of embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) mouse calvariae. PRDC mRNA expression was elevated 
by treatment with BMP-2 in osteoblastic cells isolated from E18.5 calvariae (pOB 
cells). Forced expression of PRDC using adenovirus did not affect cell numbers,
whereas it suppressed exogenous BMP activity and endogenous levels of
phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 protein. Furthermore, PRDC inhibited the expression of
bone marker genes and bone-like mineralized matrix deposition in pOB cells. In
contrast, the reduction of PRDC expression by siRNA elevated alkaline phosphatase
activity, increased endogenous levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 protein, and
promoted bone-like mineralized matrix deposition in pOB cells. These results
suggest that PRDC expression in osteoblasts suppresses differentiation and that
reduction of PRDC expression promotes osteogenesis in vitro. PRDC is accordingly 
identified as a potential novel therapeutic target for the regulation of bone
formation.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and by progressive
heterotopic bone formation in muscle tissue. Recently, a mutation involving a
single amino acid substitution in a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I
receptor, ALK2, was identified in patients with FOP. We report here that the
identical mutation, R206H, was observed in 19 Japanese patients with sporadic
FOP. This mutant receptor, ALK2(R206H), activates BMP signaling without ligand
binding. Moreover, expression of Smad1 and Smad5 was up-regulated in response to 
muscular injury. ALK2(R206H) with Smad1 or Smad5 induced osteoblastic
differentiation that could be inhibited by Smad7 or dorsomorphin. Taken together,
these findings suggest that the heterotopic bone formation in FOP may be induced 
by a constitutively activated BMP receptor signaling through Smad1 or Smad5. Gene
transfer of Smad7 or inhibition of type I receptors with dorsomorphin may
represent strategies for blocking the activity induced by ALK2(R206H) in FOP.

Amelogenin binds to both heparan sulfate and bone morphogenetic protein 2 and
pharmacologically suppresses the effect of noggin.

Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) is widely considered useful to promote tissue
regeneration during periodontal treatment. It has been reported that the main
constituent of EMD is amelogenin and that the BMP-like and TGF-beta-like activity
of EMD promotes osteogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether those
activities are dependent on amelogenin or another growth factor contained in EMD.
We performed two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of EMD, as well as Western blot
analyses using anti-amelogenin, anti-BMP2/4, and anti-TGF-beta1 antibodies, and
amino acid sequencing. Our results revealed that a large number of splicing forms
of amelogenin, BMP2/4, and other unknown molecules were involved in EMD, though
TGF-beta1 was not. In addition, we have evaluated intracellular signaling of
ERK1/2 and Smad1/5/8, binding potential and alkaline phosphatase activity and
have explored the potential regulatory relationship between amelogenin and BMP.
Amelogenin bound to BMP2 as well as heparin/heparan sulfate. Thus, it was
suggested that BMP2/4 carried over in EMD during processing promote binding
activity and phosphorylate Smad1/5/8 in osteoblasts. On the other hand,
amelogenin did not phosphorylate Smad1/5/8, but rather ERK1/2. Further,
high-density amelogenin reduced the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity
by noggin, though amelogenin did not have antagonistic properties against BMP.
Together with the above findings, our findings suggest that the BMP2/4
contaminated during the purification process of EMD because of the avidity of
amelogenin plays an important role in signaling pathway of calcification.

Heparin demonstrates several kinds of biological activities by binding to various
extracellular molecules and plays pivotal roles in bone metabolism. However, the 
role of heparin in the biological activity of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
remains unclear. In the present study, we examined whether heparin has the
effects on osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP-2 in vitro and also
elucidated the precise mechanism by which heparin regulates bone metabolism
induced by this molecule. Our results showed that heparin inhibited alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in osteoblastic cells cultured with
BMP-2. Heparin was found to suppress the mRNA expressions of osterix, Runx2, ALP 
and osteocalcin, as well as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38 MAPK. Further,
heparin bound to both BMP-2 and BMP receptor (BMPR). These results suggest that
heparin suppresses BMP-2-BMPR binding, and inhibits BMP-2 osteogenic activity in 
vitro.

morphogenetic proteins-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by regulating Smad

Recent studies have shown that the mevalonate pathway plays an important role in 
skeletal metabolism. Statins stimulate bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP-2)
production in osteoblasts, implicating a possible beneficial role for statins in 
promoting anabolic effects on bone. Here, we investigated the effects of a
lipophilic simvastatin on osteoblast differentiation using mouse myoblast C2C12
cells, in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an
inflammatory cytokine that inhibits osteogenesis. The addition of TNF-alpha to
C2C12 cells suppressed the BMP-2-induced expression of key osteoblastic markers
including Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Simvastatin had no
independent effects on Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase activity; however, it
reversed the suppressive effects of TNF-alpha. The ability of simvastatin to
reverse TNF-alpha inhibition of BMP-induced Smad1,5,8 phosphorylation and Id-1
promoter activity suggests the involvement of Smad signaling pathway in
simvastatin action. In addition, cDNA array analysis revealed that simvastatin
increased expression levels of Smads in C2C12 cells exposed to TNF-alpha that
also activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,
including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), P38, and
stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). Simvastatin
potently suppressed TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK by
inhibiting TNF-alpha-induced membrane localization of Ras and RhoA. Farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) reversed the
simvastatin effects on TNF-alpha-induced activation of Ras/Rho/MAPK pathways. FPP
and GGPP also restored the simvastatin effects on TNF-alpha-induced suppression
of Runx2 and ALP activity. In addition, simvastatin decreased the expression
levels of TNF type-1 and -2 receptor mRNAs. Collectively, simvastatin supports
BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation through antagonizing
TNF-alpha-to-Ras/Rho/MAPK pathway and augmenting BMP-Smad signaling, suggesting a
potential usage of statins to ameliorate inflammatory bone damage.

BMPs bound to specific receptors expressed on cell membrane of target cells, then
activate Smad-dependent intracellular signaling. Wnt signaling through LRP5
receptor has been genetically shown to be involved in bone formation in humans.
Recently, it was shown that Smad1 degradation requires phosphorylation by
GSK3beta, which is suppressed by Wnt signaling. These findings suggest that a
cross-talk between BMP and Wnt through Smad1 plays an important role on bone
formation.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals coordinate developmental patterning and 
have essential physiological roles in mature organisms. Here we describe the
first known small-molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling-dorsomorphin, which we
identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral axis formation in 
zebrafish. We found that dorsomorphin selectively inhibits the BMP type I
receptors ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6 and thus blocks BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8
phosphorylation, target gene transcription and osteogenic differentiation. Using 
dorsomorphin, we examined the role of BMP signaling in iron homeostasis. In
vitro, dorsomorphin inhibited BMP-, hemojuvelin- and interleukin 6-stimulated
expression of the systemic iron regulator hepcidin, which suggests that BMP
receptors regulate hepcidin induction by all of these stimuli. In vivo, systemic 
challenge with iron rapidly induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin
expression in the liver, whereas treatment with dorsomorphin blocked SMAD1/5/8
phosphorylation, normalized hepcidin expression and increased serum iron levels. 
These findings suggest an essential physiological role for hepatic BMP signaling 
in iron-hepcidin homeostasis.

Disruption of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) gene results in reduced bone
mass in mice and impairs expression of bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) an
important mediator of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. Since the
relationship between FGF-2 and BMP-2 in bone remodeling has not been fully
determined, in this study we examined whether endogenous FGF-2 was necessary for 
maximal effect of BMP-2 on periosteal bone formation in vivo and bone nodule
formation and osteoclast formation in vitro in Fgf2-/- mice. We showed that BMP-2
significantly increased periosteal bone formation by 57% in Fgf2+/+ mice but the 
changes were not significant in Fgf2-/- littermates. In line with these results
we found no significant increase in alkaline phosphatase positive (ALP) activity 
in calvarial osteoblasts or ALP mineralized colonies in stromal cultures from
Fgf2-/- mice after BMP-2 treatment. Moreover, BMP-2 induced osteoclast formation 
was also impaired in marrow stromal cultures from Fgf2-/- mice. Interestingly,
BMP-2 induced nuclear accumulation of the runt related transcription factor
(Runx2) was markedly impaired in osteoblasts from Fgf2-/- mice. Examination of
the effect of loss of FGF-2 on BMP-2 signaling pathway showed that BMP-2 caused a
similar induction of phospho-Smad1/5/8 within 30 min in calvarial osteoblasts
from both genotypes. In contrast BMP-2-induced p42/44 MAPK was reduced in Fgf2-/-
mice. These findings strongly demonstrated that endogenous FGF-2 is important in 
the maximal responses of BMP-2 in bone and that this may be dependent on the
p42/44 MAPK signaling pathway and downstream modulation of Runx2.

Disruption of heparan and chondroitin sulfate signaling enhances mesenchymal stem
cell-derived osteogenic differentiation via bone morphogenetic protein signaling 
pathways.

Cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans have
been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, including embryonic
implantation, tissue morphogenesis, wound repair, and neovascularization through 
their ability to regulate growth factor activity and morphogenic gradients.
However, the direct role of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) sugar-side chains in the 
control of human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) differentiation into the osteoblast
lineage is poorly understood. Here, we show that the abundant cell surface GAGs, 
HS and CS, are secreted in proteoglycan complexes that directly regulate the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblasts.
Enzymatic depletion of the HS and CS chains by heparinase and chondroitinase
treatment decreased HS and CS expression but did not alter the expression of the 
HS core proteins perlecan and syndecan. When digested separately, depletion of HS
and CS chains did not effect hMSC proliferation but rather increased BMP
bioactivity through SMAD1/5/8 intracellular signaling at the same time as
increasing canonical Wnt signaling through LEF1 activation. Long-term culturing
of cells in HS- and CS-degrading enzymes also increased bone nodule formation,
calcium accumulation, and the expression of such osteoblast markers as alkaline
phosphatase, RUNX2, and osteocalcin. Thus, the enzymatic disruption of HS and CS 
chains on cell surface proteoglycans alters BMP and Wnt activity so as to enhance
the lineage commitment and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.

Splicing factor 3b subunit 4 binds BMPR-IA and inhibits osteochondral cell
differentiation.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2/4 play critical roles in early embryogenesis
and skeletal development. BMP-2/4 signals conduct into cells via two types of
serine/threonine kinase receptors, known as BMPR-I (IA and IB) and BMPR-II. Here 
we identified splicing factor 3b subunit 4 (SF3b4) as a molecule that interacts
with BMPR-IA, using a yeast two-hybrid screening with a human fetal brain cDNA
library. Co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis confirmed their interaction
in mammalian cells. By separation of the cell components, SF3b4 was present in
the cell membrane fraction with BMPR-IA as well as in the nucleus. Overexpression
of SF3b4 inhibited BMP-2-mediated osteogenic and chondrocytic differentiation of 
C2C12 and ATDC5 cells, respectively, and the endogenous expression level of SF3b4
decreased during differentiation in ATDC5 cells. By reporter gene assay, SF3b4
suppressed Id reporter gene activity, specific to the Smad1/5/8 pathway, but not 
TGFbeta-mediated reporter gene activity. Biotin labeling of the cell surface
proteins followed by their immunoblot revealed that SF3b4 decreased the cell
surface BMPRI-A levels. Further analysis by molecular modeling of the
intracellular domain of BMPR-IA, coupled with binding studies of its several
mutants, indicated that the site(s) for SF3b4 binding is not directly associated 
with the C-terminal lobe and the activation segment. Taken together, these
results suggest that SF3b4, known to be localized in the nucleus and involved in 
RNA splicing, binds BMPR-IA and specifically inhibits BMP-mediated osteochondral 
cell differentiation.

GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST-1), a member of the enzyme family
catalyzing the first modification step in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate
(HS), was knocked out in mice to investigate its role in embryonic development.
NDST-1 null mice exhibited delayed endochondral bone formation including
shortened calcified zones in limbs, delayed chondrocyte and osteogenetic
differentiation, and increased chondrocyte proliferation. In situ HS binding
assay revealed that the binding ability of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -2,
-4, and -6 to endogenous HS was decreased in mutant phalanges, while that of
fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) was not affected. Up-regulation of BMPR-IA,
Phospho-Smad1 (P-Smad1) and parathyroid-hormone related protein (PTHrP), but not 
the Indian hedgehog, Gli1, Gli3, Patched, and FGFR-3, was observed. Furthermore, 
block of BMPR signaling with noggin rescued the delayed chondrocyte hypertrophic 
differentiation in NDST-1 (-/-) mice and recovered the expression of both P-Smad1
and PTHrP proteins. These results suggested that NDST-1-dependent heparan sulfate
might negatively modulate BMP and its downstream PTHrP signaling, and thus affect
endochondral bone development.

Our laboratory previously showed that osteoactivin (OA) is a novel,
osteoblast-related glycoprotein that plays a role in osteoblast differentiation
and function. The purpose of this study was to examine the regulation of OA
expression by BMP-2 and the role OA plays as a downstream mediator of BMP-2
effects in osteoblast function. Using primary osteoblast cultures, we tested
different doses of BMP-2 on the regulation of OA expression during osteoblast
development. To test whether Smad-1 signaling is responsible for BMP-2 regulation
of OA expression, osteoblast cultures were transfected with Smad1 siRNA, treated 
with 50 ng/ml of BMP-2 and analyzed by Western blot. BMP-2 treatment increased OA
mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner and this upregulation was 
blocked in Smad1 siRNA transfected cultures. We next examined whether the role of
OA as a downstream mediator of BMP-2 effects on osteoblast differentiation and
matrix mineralization. Osteoblast cultures were transfected with OA antisense
oligonucleotides and treated with 50 ng/ml of BMP-2. Cultures transfected with OA
antisense oligonucleotides and treated with BMP-2 showed a reduction of OA
expression associated with a significant reduction in early and late
differentiation markers induced by BMP-2. Therefore, OA acts, at least in part,
as a downstream mediator of BMP-2 effects on osteoblast differentiation and
matrix mineralization. Our findings suggest that BMP-2 regulates OA expression
through the Smad1 signaling pathway. Our data also emphasize that OA protein acts
as a downstream mediator of BMP-2 effects on osteoblast differentiation and
function.

Up-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB by growth factors
enhances BMP-2-induced human bone cell functions.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) stimulate osteoblast differentiation by signal 
transduction via three BMP receptors (BMPR-IA, -IB, and -II). Several growth
factors, including transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), fibroblast
growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), have
also been shown to play an important part in osteogenesis. The mechanism
underlying these activities is unclear, but these growth factors could modulate
the BMP/BMPR pathway by up-regulating BMPR expression, thereby enhancing the
osteogenic responses of bone cells to the BMP. In this study we have therefore
examined the effects of TGF-beta1, FGF-2, and PDGF-AB on BMPR expression and
BMP-2-mediated osteoblast functions in primary human bone cells. The results
showed that although the ligand BMP-2 and growth factors had little effect on
BMPR-IA and -II transcript expression, they significantly up-regulated BMPR-IB
mRNA specifically. However, only the growth factors, but not the ligand BMP-2,
increased the surface expression of the BMPR-IB antigen, which was found to be
due to a differential effect of BMP-2 and the growth factors on the
Smurf1/Smad6-induced breakdown process. Pre-incubation of the cells with the
growth factors significantly augmented BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation,
and Dlx5 expression ALP activity, compared with that of cells treated with BMP-2 
alone. When cells were transfected with siRNA targeting BMPR-IB, the growth
factors neither up-regulated BMPR-IB transcript expression nor enhanced
BMP-2-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, Dlx5 expression and ALP activity. The
results indicate that increased BMPR-IB by TGF-beta1, FGF-2, and PDGF-AB
significantly enhances BMP-2-induced osteogenic functions in vitro, suggesting
that they might positively modulate bone formation by up-regulating BMPR-IB in
vivo.

Orthodontic tooth movement induced alveolar bone resorption and formation around 
the teeth applied mechanical force. Although mechanical force can promote bone
formation, the molecular mechanism that underlies this phenomenon is not fully
understood. The purposes of this study were to determine how mechanical stress
affects the osteogenic response of human osteoblastic cells (Saos-2), and also to
examine the optimal compressive force for osteogenesis in vitro. Saos-2 cells
were cultured with or without continuously compressive force (0.5-3.0 g/cm2). The
expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), their antagonists, and
transcription factors which involved in osteogenesis were measured using
real-time PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of Smad1 was
determined by Western blot. Loading with 1.0 g/cm2 of compressive force
significantly increased the expression of BMPs, Runx2 and osterix. In contrast,
the expression of BMP antagonists and AJ18 was decreased with 1.0 g/cm2 of
compressive force. Loading with 1.0 g/cm2 of compressive force also induced
phosphorylation of Smad1. Noggin inhibited the compressive force-induced
phosphorylation of Smad1 markedly, and also partially blocked compressive
force-induced Runx2 mRNA expression. Moreover, the conditioned medium from 1.0
g/cm2 of compressive force applied cells apparently increased calcium content in 
mineralized nodules of Saos-2 culture. This study demonstrates that an optimal
compressive force stimulates in vitro mineralization via increasing BMPs
production and decreasing their antagonists production.

In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the C-type natriuretic
peptide (CNP) enhances osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) action in stimulating
osteoblastic cell differentiation in primary cultures of fetal rat calvaria cell 
(FRC). CNP enhanced synergistically the OP-1-induced Alkaline Phosphatase (AP)
activity and mineralized bone nodule formation in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. To examine possible mechanism of the synergy between OP-1 and CNP, the
expression levels of key BMP receptors and signaling molecules were examined.
Western blot analysis showed that BMPR-IB and -II receptor protein expression was
not affected by CNP alone, but was stimulated by OP-1 alone. The combination of
OP-1 and CNP did not further increase their protein levels. The Runx2 protein
expression level was not altered by CNP alone, but was elevated by OP-1 alone,
and was slightly reduced by the combination. The Smad5 protein expression level
was slightly decreased by CNP alone, but was stimulated by OP-1 alone, and was
not further stimulated by the combination. Smad5 phosphorylation was not
stimulated by CNP alone, but was stimulated significantly by OP-1 alone. The
combination of OP-1 and CNP further stimulated the OP-1-induced Smad5
phosphorylation. Thus, one mechanism of the observed synergy between OP-1 and CNP
involves enhancement of the Smad5 phosphorylation.

Enamel matrix derivative stimulates core binding factor alpha1/Runt-related
transcription factor-2 expression via activation of Smad1 in C2C12 cells.

BACKGROUND: Although enamel matrix derivative (EMD) can promote osteogenic
differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line, C2C12, the
molecular mechanism that underlies this phenomenon is unclear. The purpose of
this study was to determine which molecules in EMD stimulate osteogenic
differentiation.
METHODS: C2C12 cells were cultured in 5% serum-containing medium to induce
differentiation, either with or without the addition of EMD. The expression of
core binding factor alpha1/runtrelated transcription factor-2 (Cbfa1/Runx2) was
measured using Northern blot, Western blot, and/or real-time polymerase chain
reaction (R-PCR) analysis. Phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic
homolog 1 (Smad1) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-like molecules in EMD was 
determined by Western blot.
RESULTS: EMD increased Cbfa1/Runx2 mRNA and protein expression substantially. EMD
also induced phosphorylation of Smad1. Noggin inhibited the EMD-induced
phosphorylation of Smad1 markedly, and also partially blocked EMD-induced Cbfa1/ 
Runx2 mRNA expression. In the Western blot analysis, single bands that
corresponded to approximately 15 and approximately 17.5 kDa proteins were
recognized in EMD by anti-BMP-2/4 and anti-BMP-7 antibodies, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that EMD stimulates Cbfa1/Runx2 expression
and the phosphorylation of Smad1, and that both of these processes can be blocked
by noggin. Therefore, the osteogenic activity of EMD may be mediated by BMPlike
molecules in EMD.

To examine how fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) affects the BMP signaling
pathway during bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-induced ectopic bone
formation, we implanted type I collagen disks containing constant amounts of
BMP-2 (5 micrograms) and varying amounts of FGF-2 onto the back muscles of adult 
male mice. We then performed histological analyses and histomorphometry, and
measured bone mineral density and radiopaque area on the discs 1, 2, and 3 weeks 
after implantation. We also determined the expression profiles of several genes
involved in bone formation and the BMP signaling pathway in the muscle that had
been adjacent to the implanted disc and in muscle-derived primary culture cells
that had similarly been treated with a constant concentration of BMP-2 and a
varying concentration of FGF-2. In the presence of a constant amount of BMP-2, we
confirmed that low doses of FGF-2 increased ectopic bone formation in vivo and
high doses inhibited bone formation. Northern and/or Western blots of recovered
muscle from the in vivo experiment and treated muscle-derived primary culture
cells from the in vitro experiment revealed that low doses of FGF-2, but not high
doses, increased the expression BMP receptor (BMPR)-1B, phosphorylated Smad1,
Noggin, and Osteocalcin. Our results indicate that low-dose FGF-2 may facilitate 
BMP-2-induced ectopic bone formation by altering the expression of BMPRs on the
surface of bone forming progenitor cells. They also indicate that the inhibitory 
effect of high-dose FGF-2 is not mediated via increased expression of the BMP
inhibitor Noggin.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multi-functional growth factors that
belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily. The roles of
BMPs in embryonic development and cellular functions in postnatal and adult
animals have been extensively studied in recent years. Signal transduction
studies have revealed that Smad1, 5 and 8 are the immediate downstream molecules 
of BMP receptors and play a central role in BMP signal transduction. Studies from
transgenic and knockout mice and from animals and humans with naturally occurring
mutations in BMPs and related genes have shown that BMP signaling plays critical 
roles in heart, neural and cartilage development. BMPs also play an important
role in postnatal bone formation. BMP activities are regulated at different
molecular levels. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that BMP-2 can be
utilized in various therapeutic interventions such as bone defects, non-union
fractures, spinal fusion, osteoporosis and root canal surgery. Tissue-specific
knockout of a specific BMP ligand, a subtype of BMP receptors or a specific
signaling molecule is required to further determine the specific role of a BMP
ligand, receptor or signaling molecule in a particular tissue. BMPs are members
of the TGFbeta superfamily. The activity of BMPs was first identified in the
1960s (Urist, M.R. (1965) "Bone formation by autoinduction", Science 150,
893-899), but the proteins responsible for bone induction remained unknown until 
the purification and sequence of bovine BMP-3 (osteogenin) and cloning of human
BMP-2 and 4 in the late 1980s (Wozney, J.M. et al. (1988) "Novel regulators of
bone formation: molecular clones and activities", Science 242, 1528-1534; Luyten,
F.P. et al. (1989) "Purification and partial amino acid sequence of osteogenin, a
protein initiating bone differentiation", J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13377-13380;
Wozney, J.M. (1992) "The bone morphogenetic protein family and osteogenesis",
Mol. Reprod. Dev. 32, 160-167). To date, around 20 BMP family members have been
identified and characterized. BMPs signal through serine/threonine kinase
receptors, composed of type I and II subtypes. Three type I receptors have been
shown to bind BMP ligands, type IA and IB BMP receptors (BMPR-IA or ALK-3 and
BMPR-IB or ALK-6) and type IA activin receptor (ActR-IA or ALK-2) (Koenig, B.B.
et al. (1994) "Characterization and cloning of a receptor for BMP-2 and BMP-4
from NIH 3T3 cells", Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 5961-5974; ten Dijke, P. et al. (1994) 
"Identification of type I receptors for osteogenic protein-1 and bone
morphogenetic protein-4", J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16985-16988; Macias-Silva, M. et
al. (1998) "Specific activation of Smad1 signaling pathways by the BMP7 type I
receptor, ALK2", J. Biol. Chem. 273, 25628-25636). Three type II receptors for
BMPs have also been identified and they are type II BMP receptor (BMPR-II) and
type II and IIB activin receptors (ActR-II and ActR-IIB) (Yamashita, H. et al.
(1995) "Osteogenic protein-1 binds to activin type II receptors and induces
certain activin-like effects", J. Cell. Biol. 130, 217-226; Rosenzweig, B.L. et
al. (1995) "Cloning and characterization of a human type II receptor for bone
morphogenetic proteins", Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 92, 7632-7636; Kawabata, M. et
al. (1995) "Cloning of a novel type II serine/threonine kinase receptor through
interaction with the type I transforming growth factor-beta receptor", J. Biol.
Chem. 270, 5625-5630). Whereas BMPR-IA, IB and II are specific to BMPs, ActR-IA, 
II and IIB are also signaling receptors for activins. These receptors are
expressed differentially in various tissues. Type I and II BMP receptors are both
indispensable for signal transduction. After ligand binding they form a
heterotetrameric-activated receptor complex consisting of two pairs of a type I
and II receptor complex (Moustakas, A. and C.H. Heldi (2002) "From mono- to
oligo-Smads: the heart of the matter in TGFbeta signal transduction" Genes Dev.
16, 67-871). The type I BMP receptor substrates include a protein family, the
Smad proteins, that play a central role in relaying the BMP signal from the
receptor to target genes in the nucleus. Smad1, 5 and 8 are phosphorylated by BMP
receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (Hoodless, P.A. et al. (1996) "MADR1, a
MAD-related protein that functions in BMP2 signaling pathways", Cell 85, 489-500;
Chen Y. et al. (1997) "Smad8 mediates the signaling of the receptor serine
kinase", Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 94, 12938-12943; Nishimura R. et al. (1998)
"Smad5 and DPC4 are key molecules in mediating BMP-2-induced osteoblastic
differentiation of the pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12", J.
Biol. Chem. 273, 1872-1879). After release from the receptor, the phosphorylated 
Smad proteins associate with the related protein Smad4, which acts as a shared
partner. This complex translocates into the nucleus and participates in gene
transcription with other transcription factors (). A significant advancement
about the understanding of in vivo functions of BMP ligands, receptors and
signaling molecules has been achieved in recent years.

The differentiation of uncommitted mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts is a
fundamental molecular event governing both embryonic development and bone repair.
The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are important regulators of this process; 
they function by binding to cell surface receptors and signaling by means of Smad
proteins. Core binding factor alpha-1 (Cbfa1), a member of the runt family of
transcription factors, is an essential transcriptional regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation, and this process is positively or negatively 
regulated by a variety of coactivators and corepressors. We report that p204, an 
interferon-inducible protein that was previously shown to inhibit cell
proliferation and promote the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, is a
novel regulator in the course of osteogenesis. p204 is expressed in embryonic
osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as well as in the
calvaria osteoblasts of neonatal mice. Its level is increased in the course of
the BMP-2-triggered osteoblast differentiation of pluripotent C2C12 cells. This
increase is probably due to the activation of the gene encoding 204 (Ifi204) by
Smad transcription factor, including Smad1, -4, and -5. Overexpression of p204
enhances the BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro, as revealed by
elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production. p204 acts as a
cofactor of Cbfa1: 1) high levels of p204 augment, whereas the lowering of p204
level decreases, the Cbfa1-dependent transcription, and 2) p204 associates with
Cbfa1 both in vitro and in vivo. Two nonoverlapping segments in p204 bind to
Cbfa1, and the N-terminal 88-amino acid segment of Cbfa1 is required for binding 
to p204. p204, which is the first interferon-inducible protein found to associate
with Cbfa1, functions as a novel regulator of osteoblast differentiation.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce osteoblast differentiation and bone
formation. Smads, a group of functionally and structurally related intracellular 
effectors, mediate signaling initiated by BMPs and regulate cell definite
commitment. Previously, we showed that Smad1 activates osteopontin and
osteoprotegerin gene expression by dislodging Hoxc-8 from its DNA binding sites. 
A domain of Smad1, termed Smad1C, was characterized as interacting with Hoxc-8
and then crippling its DNA-binding ability. Ectopic expression of Smad1C is able 
to bypass BMP signaling in the induction of osteoblast differentiation and bone
formation in vitro. To test the function of Smad1C on osteogenesis in vivo, we
generated transgenic mice in which Smad1C expression was induced with doxycycline
and localized in bone by using a tetracycline-inducible expression system
(Tet-on) modified with a bone-specific gene promoter, type I collagen alpha1. The
mice expressing Smad1C showed increased skeletal bone mineral density compared
with their littermates. Bone histomorphometric analysis of mouse tibiae showed
that Smad1C significantly increases trabecular bone area and length of trabecular
surface covered with osteoid and up-regulates bone marker gene (OPN, Cbfa1, Col I
alpha1, BSP, ALP) expression in vivo. Moreover, stromal cells isolated from mice 
expressing Smad1C displayed a higher potential for differentiating into
osteoblasts than the other mice. These results indicate that Smad1C mimics BMPs
in the induction of osteogenesis in vivo. Most important, using a high throughput
screening assay based on mimicking Smad1C's displacement of Hoxc-8 binding to
DNA, we identified chemical entities that exhibit bone anabolic activity in cell 
and bone organ cultures, suggesting the possibility that the compounds may be
used as bone anabolic agents to treat bone pathologies.

bone-derived osteoblasts.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent osteoinductive factors that
accelerate osteoblast maturation, accompanied by increased cell-substrate
adhesion. BMP-2 treatment of osteoblastic cells increases phosphorylation of the 
cytoplasmic BMP-2 signaling molecules, Smad1 and Smad5. We have previously
reported that BMP-2 treatment increase cytoskeletal organization of human
trabecular bone-derived osteoblast-like cells (osteoblasts), which is also
accompanied by an activation of the focal adhesion kinase p125(FAK). We report
here that activation of p125(FAK) occurs with the same kinetics as the
phosphorylation of Smad1, suggesting that BMP-2 initiates cross-talk between Smad
signaling and the adhesion-mediated signaling pathway. As an adjunct to these
effects, we examined activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family 
members in response to focal adhesion contact formation. Although phosphorylated 
forms of all three kinases were apparent, only SAPK2alpha/p38 (p38) was activated
in response to BMP-2 treatment. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity suppressed
BMP-2 induced Smad1 phosphorylation, as well as its translocation to the nucleus,
suggesting the integration of p38 activation with Smad1 signaling. Finally,
inhibition of p38 in osteoblasts also led to the complete abrogation of BMP-2
induced osteocalcin gene expression and matrix mineralization. These findings
suggest that BMP-2 must activate p38 in order to mediate osteogenic
differentiation and maturation.

of bone morphogenetic protein inducing bone formation].

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanisms of the signal transduction of bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) inducing bone formation and to provide theoretical 
basis for basic and applying research of BMPs.
METHOD: We looked up the literature of the role of Smads and related
transcription factors in the signal transduction of BMPs inducing bone formation.
RESULTS: The signal transduction processes of BMPs included: 1. BMPs combined
with type II and type I receptors; 2. the type I receptor phosphorylated Smads;
and 3. Smads entered the cell nucleus, interacted with transcription factors and 
influenced the transcription of related proteins. Smads could be divided into
receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, Smad8 and Smad9), 
common-mediator Smad (co-Smad: Smad4), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads: Smad6 and
Smad7). Smad1, Smad5, Smad8, and probable Smad9 were involved in the signal
transduction of BMPs. Multiple kinases, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), and Akt serine/threonine kinase were related to Smads signal
transduction. Smad1 and Smad5 related with transcription factors included core
binding factor A1 (CBFA1), smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1), ornithine
decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ), activating protein-1 (AP-1), xenopus ventralizing
homeobox protein-2 (Xvent-2), sandostatin (Ski), antiproliferative proteins
(Tob), and homeodomain-containing transcriptian factor-8 (Hoxc-8), et al. CBFA1
could interact with Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5, so it was involved in
TGF-beta and BMP-2 signal transduction, and played an important role in the bone 
formation. Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) was thought to be caused by heterozygous
mutations in CBFA1. The CBFA1 knockout mice showed no osteogenesis and had
maturational disturbance of chondrocytes.
CONCLUSION: Smads and related transcription factors, especially Smad1, Smad5,
Smad8 and CBFA1, play an important role in the signal transduction of BMPs
inducing bone formation.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play important roles in the regulation of 
multiple aspects of vertebrate development. BMPs signal through the cell surface 
receptors and downstream Smad molecules. Upon stimulation with BMP, Smad1, Smad5,
and Smad8 are phosphorylated by the activated BMP receptors, form a complex with 
Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of
BMP target genes. The activity of this signal pathway can be modulated both by
extracellular factors that regulate the binding of BMPs to the receptor and by
intracellular proteins that interact with the Smad proteins. We have shown that
Ski is an important negative regulator of the Smad proteins. Ski can bind to the 
BMP-Smad protein complexes in response to BMP and repress their ability to
activate BMP target genes through disruption of a functional Smad complex and
through recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors. The antagonism of BMP
signaling by Ski results in neural specification in Xenopus embryos and
inhibition of osteoblast differentiation in mouse bone-marrow stromal progenitor 
cells. This ability to modulate BMP signaling by Ski may play an important role
in the regulation of craniofacial, neuronal, and skeletal muscle development.

The Runt domain transcription factors, RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3, are integral
components of signaling cascades mediated by both TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs) in several important biological systems. RUNX2 functions
synergistically with Smad1 and Smad5 to regulate bone-specific genes when BMP
induces osteogenesis. RUNX3, which has been mapped to locus 1p36, is a major
tumor suppressor of gastric cancer and appears to be an important component of
the TGF-beta-induced tumor suppressor pathway. A possible relationship between
the TGF-beta-induced tumor-suppressor pathway and a postulated tumor suppressor
gene on 1p36 must be examined.

Core-binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1) induces osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12
cells without interactions with Smad1 and Smad5.

Core-binding factor alpha(1) (Cbfa1) is an essential transcription factor for
osteoblastic differentiation and osteogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
is also a powerful inducer of differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells to
osteoblast lineage and bone formation. Recent studies suggest that Cbfa1 plays a 
critical role during BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation through association
with cytoplasmic BMP signaling molecules, Smads. However, other studies have
suggested that Cbfa1 may exhibit its osteogenic function without interaction with
Smads. Therefore, it remains unclear whether association with Smad is essential
for Cbfa1 function. In this study we examine the effects of Cbfa1 on osteoblastic
differentiation in the presence or absence of interactions with Smad1 or Smad5
using C2C12 undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Cbfa1 expression was induced upon
stimulation with BMP-2 in C2C12 cells. Introduction of Cbfa1 into C2C12 cells
induced osteoblastic differentiation and promoted transactivation of osteocalcin 
gene promoter without forming the complex with Smad1 or Smad5. Furthermore, in
C2C12 cells in which the association of Cbfa1 with Smad1/Smad5 was prevented by
the overexpression of the natural antagonist, Smad6, Cbfa1 still induced
osteoblastic differentiation and transactivated osteocalcin gene promoter,
regardless of BMP-2 stimulation. These results suggest that the interactions with
Smad1 or Smad5 are not essential for Cbfa1 to demonstrate its osteogenic actions.
However, interactions with Smad1/Smad5 enhance these osteogenic actions of Cbfa1.
Of note, BMP-2-induced or Smad-induced osteoblastic differentiation was inhibited
by dominant-negative Cbfa1, suggesting that the function of Cbfa1 is critical for
BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Our results suggest that Cbfa1 is
essential and also sufficient to induce osteoblastic differentiation in
undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, and establishment of an association with
Smad1/Smad5 enhances the osteogenic actions of Cbfa1. On the other hand, Cbfa1
expression requires the activation of Smad1/Smad5 by BMP-2.

Smad-interacting protein 1 is a repressor of liver/bone/kidney alkaline
phosphatase transcription in bone morphogenetic protein-induced osteogenic
differentiation of C2C12 cells.

Up-regulation of liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (LBK-ALP) has been
associated with the onset of osteogenesis in vitro. Its transcription can be
up-regulated by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), constitutively active forms
of their cognate receptors, or appropriate Smads. The promoter of LBK-ALP has
been characterized partially, but not much is known about its transcriptional
modulation by BMPs. A few Smad-interacting transcriptional factors have been
isolated to date. One of them, Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1), belongs to the 
family of two-handed zinc finger proteins binding to E2-box sequences present,
among others, in the promoter of mouse LBK-ALP. In the present study we
investigated whether SIP1 could be a candidate regulator of LBK-ALP transcription
in C2C12 cells. We demonstrate that SIP1 can repress LBK-ALP promoter activity
induced by constitutively active Alk2-Smad1/Smad5 and that this repression
depends on the binding of SIP1 to the CACCT/CACCTG cluster present in this
promoter. Interestingly, SIP1 and alkaline phosphatase expression domains in
developing mouse limb are mutually exclusive, suggesting the possibility that
SIP1 could also be involved in the transcriptional regulation of LBK-ALP in vivo.
Taken together, these results offer an intriguing possibility that ALP
up-regulation at the onset of BMP-induced osteogenesis could involve Smad/SIP1
interactions, resulting in the derepression of that gene.

The bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling mediator Smad1 participates

The role of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signaling mediator Smad1 in
osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation was investigated in murine parental
mesenchymal progenitors C3H10T1/2 and its derivatives constitutively expressing
BMP-2 (C3H10T1/2-BMP-2) and, therefore, undergo BMP-mediated osteogenic/
chondrogenic development. The functions of the three Smad1 domains, that is, the 
N-terminal (MH1) domain, the C-terminal (MH2) domain, and the midregional
proline-rich linker domain, were documented and compared with full-length Smadl. 
We showed that expression of the MH2 domain in parental C3H10T1/2 cells was
sufficient to initiate osteogenic differentiation. Interestingly, MH1 was
sufficient to initiate transcription of osteogenic marker genes like the
osteocalcin or parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTH/PTHrP) receptor. However, MH1 interfered with the histologically distinct
formation of osteoblast-like cells. A dominant-negative effect on MH2-mediated
osteogenic development in C3H10T1/2 cells was observed by the dose-dependent
trans-expression of the midregional linker domain. Importantly, in contrast to
osteogenic differentiation, Smad1 and its domains do not mimic or interfere with 
BMP-2-dependent chondrogenic development as monitored by the inability of MH2 to 
give rise to histologically distinct chondrocytes in parental C3H10T1/2 cells and
by the inefficiency of the MH1 or linker domain to interfere with BMP-2-mediated 
chondrogenic differentiation.

during endochondral ossification.

Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family transduce
signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus via specific type I and type II
receptors and Smad proteins. Smad1 and Smad5 mediate intracellular signaling of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), whereas Smad2 and Smad3 transduce TGF-beta
signaling. Smad4 is a common mediator required for both pathways. Smad6 and Smad7
inhibit signaling by members of the TGF-beta superfamily. Here, we examined the
expression of Smad1 to Smad7 proteins during endochondral ossification of
epiphyseal plate of growing rats using immunohistochemical techniques. The
expression of Smad proteins was correlated with the expression of TGF-beta1 and
its receptors, and BMP-2/4 and BMP receptors. The results show that TGF-beta1 and
BMP-2/4 were actively expressed in chondrocytes that are undergoing proliferation
and maturation, which overlaps with expression of their corresponding type I and 
type II receptors. The Smads, however, exhibited a distinct expression pattern,
respectively. For example, Smad1 and Smad5 were highly expressed in proliferating
chondrocytes and in those chondrocytes that are undergoing maturation. The
TGF-beta/activin-restricted Smads were also expressed in a nearly complementary
fashion; Smad2 was strongly expressed in proliferating chondrocytes, whereas
Smad3 was strongly observed in maturing chondrocytes. Smad4 was broadly expressed
in all zones of epiphyseal plate. Inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, were
strongly expressed in the zone of cartilage that contained mature chondrocytes.
Our findings show a colocalization of the pathway-restricted and inhibitory Smads
with activating ligands or ligands whose action they antagonize and their
receptors in various zones of epiphyseal growth plate, suggesting that TGF-beta
superfamily Smad signaling pathways plays a morphogenic role during endochondral 
bone formation.
